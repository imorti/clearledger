# ClearLedger Lab Guide

---

## What You Are Building

ClearLedger is a fintech transaction ledger — three FastAPI services, Postgres, Redis, and a web UI — secured across eight stages. The app processes credit and debit transactions and fires compliance alerts when transactions exceed a threshold.

| Service | Responsibility | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `auth-service` | Registration, login, JWT issuance | [`app/auth-service/`](../app/auth-service/) |
| `ledger-service` | Transactions, balance, history | [`app/ledger-service/`](../app/ledger-service/) |
| `notification-service` | Large-transaction alerts via Redis | [`app/notification-service/`](../app/notification-service/) |
| `frontend` | Web UI — login, dashboard, alerts | [`app/frontend/`](../app/frontend/) |

The app is the vehicle. DevSecOps is the destination.

| Stage | What changes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Raw Kubernetes | App running, manual deploys | See the system before automating it |
| 1 — CI Pipeline | Builds automate on push | Manual docker build does not scale |
| 2 — GitOps | Pipeline stops touching kubectl | Cluster and Git drift apart |
| 3 — Security Gates | Scans block every commit | Bad code reaches the cluster undetected |
| 4 — Admission Control | Kyverno enforces policy at deploy time | Bad manifests reach running pods |
| 5 — Secrets Management | Vault replaces K8s Secrets | Credentials live in Git and etcd |
| 6 — Runtime Security | Falco watches live pods | Threats inside containers go undetected |
| 6.5 — Chaos Engineering | LitmusChaos kills pods | Detection is not the same as resilience |
| 7 — Observability | Six Grafana dashboards | Security you cannot measure you cannot prove |
| 7.5 — OpenTelemetry | Distributed traces | Metrics and logs do not show the request journey |
| 8 — AWS Migration | EKS, ECR, RDS, ALB | Cloud-ready without relearning the architecture |
| — **Optional: Local stack** | Docker Compose on your host (no VM) | Try the UI and APIs before or alongside Stage 0 |

**The rule:** every stage makes you feel the problem before showing the solution.

## How to Use This Guide

**Read, do not skim.** The paragraphs before each command explain *why* you are running it. Skipping them means you can reproduce the steps but not explain them — and explaining them is what gets you hired.

**Go in order.** Each stage depends on the one before it. Jumping ahead will break things and skip context you need later.

**When something breaks, read the error.** The troubleshooting section at the end covers every common failure. Getting stuck and debugging is part of the learning — employers want to hear "I hit X error and fixed it by doing Y."

**Take screenshots.** Every crazy moment section tells you to. These become your portfolio evidence. A screenshot of Kyverno blocking a root container or Falco catching a shell exec is worth more than a paragraph on your CV.

**Estimated time:** Stages 0–2 take a full day each. Stages 3–7 take half a day each. Stage 8 takes a few hours. That is normal. Do not rush.

**Do not read this whole file upfront.** Open one stage at a time. Start with [QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) if you want the shortest path to a running cluster.

**After every stage:** run `make check-N`, then `make snapshot STAGE=N` and `make snapshots` to confirm the checkpoint exists — see [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress). From Stage 4 onward, also check platform pod restart counts — see the **Am I ready?** box at the start of each stage.

## How to think through this lab

This lab is not a checklist of installs. It is practice in three habits that matter in real jobs: understanding how things are built, choosing the right fix, and keeping systems running day to day.

**Understand before you automate.** Stage 0 makes you deploy by hand so you see what Kubernetes actually does — pods, services, secrets, ingress. Later stages add tools only after you have felt the pain they fix. When you reach Stage 2, you will already know why letting everyone run `kubectl apply` from their laptop does not work on a team.

**Choose with a reason.** Almost every step here answers a concrete question: Where do passwords live? Who is allowed to deploy? How do we know an image came from our build and not somewhere else? When the guide says to use two GitHub repos, or to scan before you push an image, or to block unsigned images — that is a decision, not a random rule. Ask yourself: *what goes wrong if we skip this?*

**Run it like production, even on a laptop.** Can you tell what version is running? Can you roll back? Can you see why a pod crashed? Checkpoints like `make check-N`, snapshots, and the troubleshooting section train you to verify work instead of assuming green text means success. When something fails, read the error, fix the cause, and note what you changed — that story is what interviews ask for.

Read the paragraphs before each command. They are the point. The commands are proof you understood.

---

## Tools you will meet (and what problem each one fixes)

You do not need to memorize this list. Come back here when a new name appears and you wonder *why now*.

**On your laptop:** Multipass runs a small Ubuntu machine so Kubernetes has enough room to breathe. Docker builds the app into containers. `make` wraps long commands into short ones like `make setup` and `make check-4`. Entries in `/etc/hosts` (like `clearledger.local`) let your browser reach the app without buying a domain.

**The app itself:** Three Python APIs (auth, ledger, notifications), a web frontend, Postgres for data, and Redis so ledger can notify alerts without calling notification directly. nginx ingress sends browser traffic to the right service.

**Kubernetes (Stage 0):** MicroK8s is a small Kubernetes cluster inside the VM. You use `kubectl` to create deployments, services, secrets, and access rules. You learn the objects first; automation comes later.

**Two GitHub repos (Stage 1):** `clearledger` holds your code and the build pipeline. `clearledger-infra` holds only Kubernetes YAML — what should be running. Splitting them means a README edit does not accidentally trigger a deploy, and you can see exactly which image tag production is supposed to use.

**GitHub Actions + self-hosted runner (Stage 1):** Every push to `main` runs tests and scans, builds images, signs them, pushes to Docker Hub, and updates image tags in `clearledger-infra`. The runner lives inside your VM because GitHub’s cloud runners cannot reach your local cluster or `clearledger.local`.

**ArgoCD (Stage 2):** Watches `clearledger-infra` and applies changes to the cluster. After Stage 1, the infra repo updates but the cluster might not — that gap is intentional. ArgoCD closes it: Git says what should run; the cluster catches up.

**Scan tools in the pipeline (Stage 3):** Gitleaks hunts passwords committed to git. Semgrep reads your Python for unsafe patterns. Checkov checks Kubernetes YAML for risky settings. Trivy scans container images for known CVEs. Syft lists what is inside an image; Grype checks that list for vulnerabilities. Cosign signs the image so Stage 4 can reject anything unsigned.

**Kyverno (Stage 4):** A gate at the cluster front door. Even if someone bypasses CI, Kyverno can block pods that run as root, skip resource limits, or use unsigned images.

**Vault (Stage 5):** Stores passwords and keys outside Git and outside Kubernetes secret objects. A small sidecar in each pod fetches credentials at startup. You delete the old Kubernetes secrets and login still works — that is the lesson.

**Falco + network policies (Stage 6):** Falco watches running containers for suspicious actions (like an unexpected shell). Network policies limit which pods can talk to which — a stolen pod cannot reach everything.

**Litmus (Stage 6.5, optional):** Deliberately kills a pod so you prove the app stays up and Kubernetes replaces it. Detection is not the same as surviving failure.

**Prometheus, Grafana, Loki (Stage 7):** Prometheus collects numbers (CPU, request rates, errors). Grafana draws dashboards. Loki stores logs so you can search without opening each pod. You need this to show security and reliability with evidence, not guesses.

**OpenTelemetry + Tempo (Stage 7.5, optional):** Follows one login or transaction across auth → ledger → notification as a single trace. Metrics tell you something is slow; traces show where time was spent.

**AWS pieces (Stage 8):** Terraform creates VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, and IAM roles in code. EKS is Kubernetes in AWS. ECR holds images. RDS is managed Postgres. The load balancer replaces nginx for public access. External Secrets Operator pulls passwords from AWS Secrets Manager. Same app patterns as the homelab — different endpoints.

**Helper scripts:** `scripts/health-check.sh` and `make check-N` tell you if a stage is actually done. Snapshots save the VM before risky steps. `docs/troubleshooting.md` maps common errors to fixes.

Each stage adds one layer. None of them replace the others. Scans do not stop a hacker inside a running pod; Falco does not build your image; ArgoCD does not store passwords. That is why the order matters.

---

### The checkpoint rule (read this once)

Every major section ends with a **✋ Hands-on checkpoint**. That is not optional, its how you avoid the silent failures that make learners quit.

**You do this yourself:**

1. Run the command in your terminal (copy-paste is fine).
2. Compare your output to **Expected** — character for character where it matters.
3. If it does not match, fix it **in this stage** before continuing. Do not “hope Stage 2 fixes it.”
4. When `make check-N` passes: `make snapshot STAGE=N`, then `make snapshots` — advance only after you see `clearledger.stageN` in the list.

**You never:**

- Skip a checkpoint because `make check-N` passed last time
- Advance without confirming your snapshot landed (`make snapshots` must show `clearledger.stageN`)
- Run `make restore` without `make snapshots` first — list what you can roll back to, then pick the stage
- Type `your-username` or `YOUR_USERNAME` literally — replace with your real Docker Hub / GitHub username
- Run runner commands on your Mac host (prompt must show `ubuntu@clearledger`)

If you are stuck for more than 15 minutes on one checkpoint, open [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for that stage — the fix is manual, not a hidden script.

### Saving your progress

**Mac + Multipass only:** `make snapshot` and `make restore` need a Multipass VM. Linux without Multipass has no snapshot command — use Path B below if something breaks.

This lab takes days. Your **source code lives on your host** in the Git repo — a broken or deleted VM never loses your commits, manifests, or local config. What you can lose is **cluster state** inside the VM (deployed pods, Vault secrets, in-cluster Grafana work).

**Three commands, two moments.** Snapshots bracket the risky parts of a multi-day run: confirm right after you create one, list again before you restore.

| Moment | When | What to run |
|---|---|---|
| **Save** | `make check-N` passes | `make snapshot STAGE=N` → `make snapshots` |
| **Recover** | VM sick; you need to roll back | `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=N` |

**After each stage** — save and confirm before you advance:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=7
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage7 — do not skip
```

**Why confirm?** On Multipass older than 1.13, `make snapshot` prints a warning and exits without error. Listing is the only proof the checkpoint exists. Requires Multipass 1.13+ — check with `multipass version` (`brew upgrade --cask multipass` on macOS).

**If the VM goes bad at any stage** (disk full, Loki crash-loop, API timeouts, corrupt cluster — common around Stage 7):

| What survives | What you lose inside the VM |
|---|---|
| This Git repo, your commits, `.env`, `setup-cluster.local.env` | Running pods, Vault KV, Postgres data, Grafana/Loki state |
| **`clearledger-infra` on GitHub** — do not delete it; ArgoCD will sync again after recovery | Anything not snapshotted since your last `make check-N` |

**Path A — you saved a snapshot** (recommended):

```bash
make snapshots                              # list first — which clearledger.stageN exist?
make restore STAGE=6                        # pick the newest good stage before the blow-up
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/clearledger-config
bash scripts/ensure-kubeconfig.sh           # if kubectl cannot reach the cluster
make check-6                                # confirm before continuing
```

`make restore` is **destructive** — it discards the broken VM state and replaces it with the snapshot. You do **not** need `make teardown` first. Use `STAGE=65` or `STAGE=75` if you snapshot optional stages.

**Path B — no snapshot** (slower, still fine):

```bash
make teardown && make setup
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/clearledger-config
```

Then **re-walk stages on the VM** from where you need to be (empty cluster after `make setup` — not “Stage 7 only”). Your **`clearledger-infra` repo stays**; re-install platform pieces (ArgoCD, Kyverno, Vault, Falco, observability) per the LAB-GUIDE for each stage. Re-seed Vault in Stage 5 if you had passed it.

**Path C — disk pressure but cluster still responds:**

```bash
make doctor
make reclaim          # if WARN/FAIL — see [Disk health](#disk-health-long-running-lab-vm)
```

If reclaim does not help → Path A or Path B.

**Path D — Mac reboot or sleep; cluster responds but app pods are sick** (try this **before** `make restore` if you passed Stage 5+):

Common after closing the laptop or a Multipass hang: `auth-service` / `ledger-service` show **Unknown** or stay **Init:0/1**; `vault-agent-init` logs show `permission denied` on `auth/kubernetes/login`. Postgres and frontend may still be **Running**. Vault’s in-memory dev config lost its Kubernetes auth binding — the fix is re-run Stage 5 setup, not a full VM restore.

**Multipass won’t respond** (`cannot connect to the multipass socket`, `multipass start` spins forever): reboot the Mac, open **Multipass** from Applications, wait 60s, then `multipass list`.

**App pods sick but `kubectl` works:**

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/clearledger-config
kubectl get pods -n clearledger

# Stale pods from the crash — delete Unknown auth/ledger pods (skip if already recreated)
kubectl delete pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
kubectl delete pod -n clearledger -l app=ledger-service

# Confirm Vault init is the blocker (expect permission denied if this is the issue)
kubectl logs -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -c vault-agent-init --tail=10

# Re-bind Vault K8s auth + re-seed secrets (requires stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env)
bash stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/vault/setup.sh
bash stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/vault/seed-vault-secrets.sh

# Restart app pods so vault-agent-init runs again
kubectl delete pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
kubectl delete pod -n clearledger -l app=ledger-service

# Wait ~1 minute, then verify
kubectl get pods -n clearledger          # auth + ledger should be 2/2 Running
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/auth/health   # want 200
SKIP_CHAOS_CHECK=1 make check-7
```

**Pass:** auth and ledger **2/2 Running**, `/auth/health` returns **200**, `make check-7` passes. Grafana panels may be empty until you re-run §7.4 exercises (Loki may have lost recent logs) — that is normal.

**Still broken after Path D?** Use Path A: `make snapshots` then `make restore STAGE=7` (or the newest good `clearledger.stageN` you have).

---

## Choose your path

Pick **one** path from your **host RAM** before you provision a cluster. Switching mid-lab after OOM kills or disk pressure wastes a day — choose upfront.

| Your situation | Path | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **8 GB RAM**, or unsure this laptop can carry the lab | **Docker Compose first** (no Kubernetes) | The real app: register, post a transaction, see the compliance alert fire. Then decide on a cluster. → `make integration-up` · [Local integration stack](#local-integration-stack--app-first-on-ramp) |
| **16 GB RAM** on the host | **Lite local cluster** (Stages **0–5**) | CV core on one VM: Kubernetes, CI/CD, GitOps, security gates, admission control, Vault. Use `scripts/setup-cluster.lite.env` with `make setup` (file added separately — smaller VM footprint). |
| **Under 16 GB** host RAM **and** you need Kubernetes, **or** you want **all 8 stages** | **Cloud VM** | Provision a remote machine (4–8 vCPU, 16–32 GB RAM), clone the repo, run the lab there, `make teardown` when done. Stages **6.5 / 7 / 7.5** (chaos + full observability) need **24 GB** on the host — use this path if your laptop cannot spare that. |

The default path in this guide assumes **24 GB+ RAM** and the full local VM ([Before You Start](#before-you-start)). If that is not you, start from the row that matches your machine — not from `make setup` by reflex.

---

## Who This Is For

**Junior DevOps (0–2 yrs):** do every stage in order. Do not skip the pain point sections. Expect Stage 0–2 to take a full day each. That is normal.

**Mid-level DevOps (2–4 yrs):** skim Stages 0–2 to understand the app, focus time on Stages 3–7 where the security layers are.

**Interview preparation:** complete through Stage 4, then read `docs/interview-prep.md`. The questions are based on exactly what is in this lab.

### What to put on your CV when you finish

By Stage 4, you can truthfully write:

> Built and secured a multi-service fintech application on Kubernetes with CI/CD (GitHub Actions + self-hosted runner), GitOps (ArgoCD), SAST/SCA/IaC scanning (Semgrep, Trivy, Checkov), image signing (Cosign), and admission control (Kyverno). Implemented compliance controls mapping to PCI-DSS, SOC2, and CIS Kubernetes benchmarks.

By Stage 7, add:

> Implemented runtime threat detection (Falco), secrets management (HashiCorp Vault), network segmentation, chaos engineering (LitmusChaos), and security observability dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) with DORA metrics tracking.

These are not buzzwords anymore because you built every one of them. The screenshots prove it.

---

## Before You Start

### Which setup is yours?

The lab is **written and tested for Mac + Multipass**. You can finish every stage on Linux or Windows too — just follow the row that matches your machine:

| You are on… | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Mac** | Follow the guide as written. Run `make setup`, then `bash scripts/configure-vm-network.sh` if CI builds fail on DNS. |
| **Linux** (MicroK8s on the host, no Multipass) | Skip `multipass` commands. Run scripts with `--inside-vm` on the host (e.g. `bash scripts/configure-vm-network.sh --inside-vm`). **No `make snapshot`** — save progress with `make teardown && make setup` and re-walk stages ([Path B](#saving-your-progress)). |
| **Windows** | Install **WSL2 Ubuntu**. Run the **whole lab inside WSL** — not PowerShell. Follow the **Linux** row above from inside WSL. |

**Open a URL in the browser**

```bash
# macOS
open http://grafana.local

# Linux or WSL2
xdg-open http://grafana.local
```

**CI builds fail on DNS?** Run the network fix on the machine that has Docker and MicroK8s:

```bash
# Mac (from repo root — talks to the Multipass VM for you)
bash scripts/configure-vm-network.sh

# Linux or WSL2 (on that same machine)
bash scripts/configure-vm-network.sh --inside-vm
```

Details: [troubleshooting — CI DNS](troubleshooting.md#ci-build-fails-dns-server-misbehaving-or-could-not-resolve-host).

### System requirements

- **24 GB RAM minimum** (the VM needs 12 GB reserved; 32 GB+ recommended for Stages 7–7.5)
- **6 CPU cores minimum** on the host (the VM uses 6 by default; 8 if you use `setup-cluster.local.env`)
- **80 GB free disk space** on your host for the full lab through Stages 7–7.5 (`make setup` provisions an 80 GB VM disk by default). **60 GB is enough** if you plan to stop after Stage 4 — you will not need the extra room until the observability and tracing stacks in Stages 7–7.5. Those stages pull several large container images and retain metrics/logs on disk; the default VM size accounts for that so you are not resizing mid-lab. If you keep the VM running for days between sessions, run **`make doctor`** weekly — see [Disk health (long-running lab VM)](#disk-health-long-running-lab-vm).
- macOS, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), or Windows 10/11

### Install on your host machine

| Tool | What it does | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multipass | Creates lightweight Ubuntu VMs on your laptop | `brew install --cask multipass` | `sudo snap install multipass` | [multipass.run/install](https://multipass.run/install) |
| kubectl | Talks to your Kubernetes cluster from your terminal | `brew install kubectl` | `sudo snap install kubectl --classic` | `winget install Kubernetes.kubectl` |
| Helm | Package manager for Kubernetes (like apt/brew but for cluster apps) | `brew install helm` | `sudo snap install helm --classic` | `winget install Helm.Helm` |
| Docker Desktop | Builds container images on your machine | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) |
| jq | Formats JSON output so you can read it | `brew install jq` | `sudo apt install jq` | `winget install jqlang.jq` |

> **Windows:** Use **WSL2 Ubuntu** for all lab commands. PowerShell cannot run `make` or `scripts/*.sh`.

Verify everything before continuing:

```bash
multipass --version
kubectl version --client --short
helm version --short
docker --version
jq --version
```

If any command fails, fix it now. Every stage depends on these.

---

## One Command to Start

```bash
make          # shows all available commands
make setup    # provisions the VM and cluster
```

After `make setup` finishes, it adds `KUBECONFIG` to your `~/.zshrc` so every future terminal knows where the cluster is. Your **current** terminal was already open before that happened, so run this once:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/clearledger-config
kubectl get nodes   # should show Ready
```

Any new terminal you open after this will work automatically. Then continue:

```bash
make stage-0  # opens Stage 0 and shows what you're building
```

---

## Disk health (long-running lab VM)

The lab runs on a **single-node MicroK8s VM** with a fixed disk (80 GB by default). Over days or weeks — especially after CI builds, Helm upgrades, and Stage 7 observability — container images, logs, and journald can fill the root filesystem. Pods then fail with `Evicted`, `ImagePullBackOff`, or mysterious `Pending` states that look like app bugs.

`make setup` applies **preventive caps** automatically (idempotent — safe to re-run on a fresh VM):

| Layer | Setting | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Kubelet | `--container-log-max-size=10Mi`, `--container-log-max-files=3` | Rotates container logs instead of growing without bound |
| Kubelet | `--image-gc-high-threshold=80`, `--image-gc-low-threshold=60` | Garbage-collects unused images when disk use crosses 80% |
| journald | `SystemMaxUse=300M` in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` | Caps systemd logs inside the VM |

Configured in [`scripts/setup-cluster.sh`](../scripts/setup-cluster.sh) immediately after MicroK8s is enabled.

### Commands

```bash
make doctor    # report only — VM disk %, top PVC namespaces, Prometheus TSDB size
make reclaim   # reclaim safe cruft inside the VM (see below)
```

**`make doctor`** prints a **PASS / WARN / FAIL** verdict:

| Verdict | Root disk used | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **PASS** | under 75% | No action needed |
| **WARN** | 75–89% | Run `make reclaim`; plan to finish heavy stages or tear down soon |
| **FAIL** | 90%+ | Run `make reclaim` immediately; if still FAIL, tear down and `make setup` |

On WARN or FAIL, doctor prints: `Hint: run make reclaim`.

**`make reclaim`** runs **inside the VM** and only touches safe targets:

- Prunes **unused** container images (`microk8s ctr` — images still referenced by running pods are kept)
- Vacuums journald down to **200M**
- Prints **before/after** `df` for `/`

It does **not** delete PVCs, Prometheus TSDB blocks, or any workload data.

### When to use

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| VM left running for several days between lab sessions | `make doctor` |
| Before Stage 7 (Prometheus + Loki are disk-heavy) | `make doctor` — reclaim if WARN/FAIL |
| After many Stage 1 CI runs (new images accumulate on the runner) | `make doctor` then `make reclaim` if needed |
| Pods `Evicted` or node reports disk pressure | `make doctor` then `make reclaim` |
| Doctor shows **WARN** or **FAIL** | `make reclaim` |

### When **not** to use

| Situation | Why |
|---|---|
| Doctor shows **PASS** | Reclaim frees little; unnecessary churn |
| You expect reclaim to shrink **PVC / Postgres / Prometheus metrics** | Reclaim never touches PVCs or TSDB — only images and journald |
| You are mid-checkpoint and have not read the error yet | Evicted pods may be a **disk** problem, but confirm with `make doctor` before assuming |
| You need a **clean slate** | `make teardown` then `make setup` — reclaim is for keeping a long-running VM alive, not resetting the lab |
| VM broken but you have a snapshot | `make snapshots` then `make restore STAGE=N` — see [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress) |

### VM created before disk-safety was added

If your VM predates this feature, `make doctor` and `make reclaim` still work. Kubelet and journald caps are applied only on **`make setup`** (new VM). To add caps to an **existing** VM without rebuilding, re-run the disk-safety block from [`scripts/setup-cluster.sh`](../scripts/setup-cluster.sh) (the `DISKSAFETY` heredoc after MicroK8s enable) — it is idempotent. Alternatively: `make teardown` and `make setup` for a fresh 80 GB VM.

More detail: [troubleshooting.md — VM disk full](troubleshooting.md#vm-disk-full-or-nearly-full).

## Local integration stack — app-first on-ramp

**Start here if you chose the 8 GB path** in [Choose your path](#choose-your-path) — or anytime you want to learn the app before Multipass and MicroK8s. Same three APIs plus the web UI on your laptop with Docker only; no `kubectl`, no VM, no ingress setup. This is the official low-resource entry to ClearLedger, not a side quest.

This is **not a numbered stage**. When you are ready for Kubernetes, continue at [Stage 0](#stage-0--the-running-system) or return here between cluster sessions to sanity-check the UI.

| | Local stack | Main lab (Stage 0+) |
|---|---|---|
| URL | **http://localhost:3000** | **http://clearledger.local** |
| Infra | [`docker-compose.integration.yml`](../docker-compose.integration.yml) | Multipass + MicroK8s + ingress |
| Data | Ephemeral Postgres in Compose (wiped on `down -v`) | Postgres in the cluster |

### Start and stop

```bash
# From the repo root on your host (Docker Desktop running)
docker compose -f docker-compose.integration.yml up --build -d

# Open the UI
# macOS:        open http://localhost:3000
# Linux/WSL2:   xdg-open http://localhost:3000

# Automated API + UI checks (12 assertions)
bash scripts/test-frontend-integration.sh

# Stop (add -v to delete the database volume)
docker compose -f docker-compose.integration.yml down
```

### First-time sign-in

1. **Register** — the database starts empty after each fresh `up` (or `down -v`).
2. Use a real-looking email (Pydantic rejects `@*.local`), for example:
   - Email: `test@clearledger.io`
   - Password: `SecurePass123`
3. **Sign in** with the same credentials.

Wrong password shows *Incorrect email or password*. If you see a stale error, hard-refresh or run `localStorage.removeItem('cl_token')` in the browser console.

### Demo flow (matches Stage 0 curl lab)

1. Register and sign in at http://localhost:3000
2. Submit a few credits and debits (e.g. Salary +$5000, Rent −$1200)
3. Confirm balance updates and history lists entries
4. Submit a transaction **≥ $10,000** — the Alerts panel should show `LARGE_TRANSACTION`

Optional smoke test against the same base URL:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 bash scripts/dast/smoke.sh
```

When you continue the main lab, deploy to Kubernetes as in Stage 0 and use **clearledger.local** — the UI and APIs behave the same; only the hostname and backing infra change.

---

## Domain Names

`make setup` adds the six lab hostnames to `/etc/hosts` for you. You only need this section if that step failed or you set up the cluster by hand.

**What the names are for:** Your browser needs to know where `clearledger.local` points. `make setup` maps it (and five other names) to your cluster IP. One hostname for the app — paths like `/auth` and `/ledger` route inside the cluster. Names like `grafana.local` and `argocd.local` are for tools you install in later stages.

### Mac or Linux with Multipass (default)

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup-hosts.sh
```

Or by hand:

```bash
VMIP=$(multipass info clearledger | grep IPv4 | awk '{print $2}')
echo "$VMIP  clearledger.local argocd.local grafana.local vault.local falco.local litmus.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Test: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/auth/health` → expect `200` after Stage 0.

### WSL2 (MicroK8s runs inside WSL)

WSL does **not** use `multipass info`. Do this **inside your WSL terminal**:

**Step 1 — find an IP that works**

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1/auth/health
```

If that returns `200` (after Stage 0), use `127.0.0.1`. If not, try your WSL IP:

```bash
ip -4 addr show eth0 | grep inet
```

Use the `inet` address (e.g. `172.x.x.x`).

**Step 2 — add to hosts inside WSL**

```bash
LAB_IP=127.0.0.1   # change if step 1 needed a different IP
echo "$LAB_IP  clearledger.local argocd.local grafana.local vault.local falco.local litmus.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Step 3 — only if you use a Windows browser (Chrome/Edge outside WSL)**

Add the **same line** to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (open Notepad **as Administrator**). Use the same `LAB_IP` as in WSL.

Test inside WSL: `curl http://clearledger.local/auth/health`

<summary>Manual Multipass hosts (same as Mac block above)</summary>

```

## Stage 0 — The Running System

> The system works. But every change is manual, unaudited, and fragile.

**Goal:** ClearLedger is running on Kubernetes. You deployed everything by hand. You can register a user, create a transaction, and see a compliance alert fire. No automation exists yet. That is intentional — you need to feel what manual operations actually cost before you understand why every subsequent stage exists.

> **Am I ready for Stage 0?**
>
> - [ ] Host meets [system requirements](#before-you-start) (24 GB+ RAM recommended)
> - [ ] `multipass`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `docker`, and `jq` installed and verified
> - [ ] Docker Desktop running (needed later for image builds)
>
> **Done when:** `make check-0` passes and `http://clearledger.local` shows the login screen.
> **Then save:** `make snapshot STAGE=0` → `make snapshots` (confirm `clearledger.stage0`).

### 0.1 — Provision the cluster

**What you are doing:** creating a virtual machine on your laptop that runs its own Kubernetes cluster. Think of it as a miniature data center inside your computer.

**Multipass** creates lightweight Ubuntu VMs. **MicroK8s** is a minimal Kubernetes distribution that runs inside that VM. Together they give you a real cluster without needing cloud resources.

**Recommended — one command (do this):**

```bash
make setup
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/clearledger-config
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected:

```
NAME          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
clearledger   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.29.x
```

`make setup` runs `scripts/setup-cluster.sh` (VM + MicroK8s + disk-safety caps) and `scripts/setup-hosts.sh` (`/etc/hosts` entries). Takes 3–5 minutes.

Disk-safety (log rotation, image GC thresholds, journald cap) is configured automatically — see [Disk health](#disk-health-long-running-lab-vm). After the cluster has been up for a while, run `make doctor` before Stage 7.

If STATUS is `NotReady`, wait 60 seconds and try again.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (only if <code>make setup</code> failed and you need to debug step by step)</summary>

```bash
multipass launch \
  --name clearledger \
  --cpus 6 --memory 12G --disk 80G \
  22.04
```

Get the VM IP (needed for `/etc/hosts`):

```bash
multipass info clearledger | grep IPv4
```

Add hosts entries — see the [Domain Names](#domain-names) section above, or run `sudo bash scripts/setup-hosts.sh`.

```bash
multipass shell clearledger
```

Inside the VM:

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.29/stable
sudo usermod -aG microk8s ubuntu && newgrp microk8s
microk8s enable dns ingress storage helm3 rbac
echo "alias kubectl='microk8s kubectl'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias helm='microk8s helm3'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
kubectl get nodes
exit   # back to your host machine
```

Connect kubectl from your host:

```bash
multipass exec clearledger -- microk8s config > ~/.kube/clearledger-config
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/clearledger-config
kubectl get nodes
```

</details>

---

### 0.2 — Understand the application before deploying it

Open these files before running a single `kubectl` command. Reading the code first builds context that makes everything else make sense.

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`app/auth-service/main.py`](../app/auth-service/main.py) | Register, login, verify JWT |
| [`app/ledger-service/main.py`](../app/ledger-service/main.py) | Transactions, balance — calls auth-service to verify every request |
| [`app/notification-service/main.py`](../app/notification-service/main.py) | Subscribes to Redis, fires alerts when amount ≥ $10,000 |
| [`app/frontend/src/app.js`](../app/frontend/src/app.js) | SPA — calls the same API as the curl commands |
| [`app/auth-service/Dockerfile`](../app/auth-service/Dockerfile) | Non-root user, pinned base image, HEALTHCHECK |

Notice in every Dockerfile: `USER appuser`. The container does not run as root. This matters more than you think right now — in Stage 4, Kyverno will automatically reject any container that tries to run as root. You are seeing the security requirement before you see the enforcement.

Also look at [`infra/manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml`](../infra/manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml). The database password is `changeme-stage0` encoded in base64. Decode it:

```bash
echo "Y2hhbmdlbWUtc3RhZ2Uw" | base64 -d
# changeme-stage0
```

That password is sitting in a YAML file anyone with repo access can read. base64 is encoding, not encryption — it is trivially reversible. Remember this moment. It is why Stage 5 exists.

---

### 0.3 — Docker Hub setup

You need a container registry — a place to store the built images so the cluster can pull them. Docker Hub is the simplest option. You will replace it with a private registry (ECR) in Stage 8.

Create four public repositories on Docker Hub (free account, hub.docker.com):

```
YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service
YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-ledger-service
YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-notification-service
YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-frontend
```

Generate an access token: hub.docker.com → Account Settings → Security → New Access Token (Read/Write/Delete). Save it — you will not see it again.

```bash
docker login
# Username: your Docker Hub username
# Password: the access token (NOT your account password)
```

Build and push all four services:

```bash
# Replace your-username with your Docker Hub username — the same string everywhere in this lab
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-username
echo "Using DOCKER_USERNAME=$DOCKER_USERNAME"
```

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — Docker Hub username**

```bash
# Must print your real username, not the literal text "your-username"
echo "$DOCKER_USERNAME"
```

Expected: one line with your Docker Hub name (e.g. `$DOCKER_USERNAME`). If you see `your-username`, stop and fix `export` before building.

Build and push all four services:

```bash
docker build -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.1.0 ./app/auth-service
docker build -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-ledger-service:v0.1.0 ./app/ledger-service
docker build -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-notification-service:v0.1.0 ./app/notification-service
docker build -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-frontend:v0.1.0 ./app/frontend

docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.1.0
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-ledger-service:v0.1.0
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-notification-service:v0.1.0
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-frontend:v0.1.0
```

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — images on Docker Hub**

1. Open hub.docker.com → your profile → **Repositories**.
2. Confirm all four `clearledger-*` repos exist and each shows tag **`v0.1.0`**.
3. On your laptop, run:

```bash
docker pull $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.1.0
```

Expected: `Status: Downloaded newer image` or `Image is up to date` — not `repository does not exist` or `denied`.

---

### 0.4 — Look at the manifests before applying them

**What are manifests?** YAML files that tell Kubernetes what to create. Each file describes a resource — a Deployment (runs your containers), a Service (gives them a network address), a Secret (stores credentials), or an Ingress (routes external traffic). Kubernetes reads these files and makes reality match the description.

| Manifest | What it creates |
|---|---|
| [`infra/manifests/namespace.yaml`](../infra/manifests/namespace.yaml) | The `clearledger` namespace — an isolated area within the cluster |
| [`infra/manifests/rbac/rbac.yaml`](../infra/manifests/rbac/rbac.yaml) | Security permissions — who is allowed to do what inside the cluster (explained below) |
| [`infra/manifests/postgres/`](../infra/manifests/postgres/) | Postgres StatefulSet — note `runAsUser: 70` (the postgres user in Alpine, not root) |
| [`infra/manifests/redis/redis.yaml`](../infra/manifests/redis/redis.yaml) | Redis Deployment — used as a message bus for notifications |
| [`infra/manifests/auth-service/`](../infra/manifests/auth-service/) | Service + Secret (Stage 0). **Deployment for Stage 0** is under [`stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests/`](../stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests/) — see §0.5 |
| [`infra/manifests/ledger-service/`](../infra/manifests/ledger-service/) | Same pattern as auth-service |
| [`infra/manifests/frontend/deployment.yaml`](../infra/manifests/frontend/deployment.yaml) | Stage 0: use [`stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests/frontend/`](../stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests/frontend/deployment.yaml) |
| [`infra/manifests/ingress.yaml`](../infra/manifests/ingress.yaml) | Routes external traffic to the correct service based on the URL path |

**About the Ingress file:** this is where most beginners get confused, so read this carefully.

Your cluster has four services running: frontend, auth-service, ledger-service, and notification-service. Each one has its own internal address inside the cluster (called a Service), but none of them are reachable from your browser. They are hidden inside the cluster's private network.

The **Ingress** is the front door. It tells Kubernetes: "when a request arrives from outside the cluster, look at the URL and forward it to the right service."

Here is how the routing works:

```text
Browser request                 Ingress decision              Backend service
─────────────────              ──────────────────            ────────────────
clearledger.local/             →  path starts with /         →  frontend
clearledger.local/auth/login   →  path starts with /auth     →  auth-service
clearledger.local/ledger/balance → path starts with /ledger  →  ledger-service
clearledger.local/notifications/alerts → path starts with /notifications → notification-service
```

Notice every row uses the same hostname. When you open [`infra/manifests/ingress.yaml`](../infra/manifests/ingress.yaml), you'll only see `clearledger.local` listed twice — not four different hosts. That's intentional: one front door, and the path decides where the request goes. If you're looking for `auth.local` or wondering where `grafana.local` went, you're in the right place to be confused — those other `/etc/hosts` names are for tools you'll set up in later stages, each with its own Ingress manifest. This file is just the ClearLedger app.

The Ingress also **strips the prefix** before forwarding. So when your browser requests `/auth/login`, the Ingress removes `/auth` and sends just `/login` to auth-service. This is called a **rewrite**. The backend services do not know about the prefix — they only see their own routes (`/login`, `/register`, `/health`, etc.).

Open [`infra/manifests/ingress.yaml`](../infra/manifests/ingress.yaml) and read the comments. The file creates two Ingress resources:

- **`clearledger-api`** — handles `/auth`, `/ledger`, and `/notifications` paths. Uses regex to strip the prefix before forwarding.
- **`clearledger-frontend`** — handles `/` (everything else). No rewrite — passes the path through unchanged so static files like CSS and JavaScript load correctly.

Why two instead of one? The API services need the prefix stripped (rewrite). The frontend does not — it needs the full path preserved so `/style.css` stays `/style.css`. Mixing both behaviors in a single Ingress requires hacks. Two Ingress resources with clear, separate behavior is the standard production pattern.

The nginx Ingress controller (which MicroK8s provides via `microk8s enable ingress`) merges both resources internally. It serves them from a single entry point but applies the correct rules to each path.

**About the RBAC file — the next layer after Ingress.** Ingress answered a question about *outside* traffic: when someone hits `clearledger.local`, which service gets the request? RBAC answers a different question about *inside* the cluster: when a pod (or a person with `kubectl`) talks to the Kubernetes API, what is it allowed to do?

You don't need RBAC to get the app running in §0.5 — but you do need to understand it before you apply manifests blindly. Open [`infra/manifests/rbac/rbac.yaml`](../infra/manifests/rbac/rbac.yaml); the comments at the top mirror the walkthrough below.

**Step 1 — Give each app an identity.** Every pod runs as a **ServiceAccount**. Think of it as an ID badge: when auth-service calls the Kubernetes API, the cluster knows *which* app is asking, not just "some pod in clearledger."

**Step 2 — Define what that identity may do.** A **Role** is a short list of allowed actions — for example, auth-service may `get` and `list` **Endpoints** (internal service addresses) so it can discover where Postgres lives. It may *not* read Secrets, delete pods, or touch other namespaces. That's **least privilege**: only the permissions the app actually needs.

**Step 3 — Attach the permissions to the identity.** A **RoleBinding** connects a ServiceAccount to a Role. Without the binding, the Role exists but nobody wears it — the app would still run on the default account with whatever that account allows.

**Step 4 — Separate humans from apps.** The file also defines a **viewer** ServiceAccount: enough access to inspect pods and services for debugging, but no Secret access. Useful when you want someone (or a monitoring tool) to look around without handing them the keys.

**Step 5 — Lock down the default.** If a Deployment forgets to set `serviceAccountName`, the pod falls back to the namespace's **default** ServiceAccount. Here, that account is deliberately given **zero** permissions — so a misconfigured pod can't accidentally inherit broad cluster access.

Why bother? If auth-service were compromised, an attacker with a over-privileged ServiceAccount could read Secrets or poke at other workloads through the API. Tight RBAC limits the blast radius to what that one app was ever allowed to do.

**Two manifest trees — read this before §0.5:**

| Path | When you use it | Secret pattern |
|---|---|---|
| [`stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests/`](../stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests/) | **Stage 0 manual deploy** (now) | `secretKeyRef` → Kubernetes Secrets |
| [`infra/manifests/`](../infra/manifests/) | **Stage 2–4 GitOps** (ArgoCD / CI) | `secretKeyRef` → Kubernetes Secrets (same as Stage 0) |
| [`stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/manifests/`](../stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/manifests/) | **Stage 5 GitOps upgrade** | Vault agent injection — copy into `infra/manifests/` at Stage 5 only |

Stage 0 always uses the **stage-0** deployment files. `infra/manifests/*/deployment.yaml` uses `secretKeyRef` until Stage 5 — safe for ArgoCD from Stage 2 onward. Do **not** sync Vault deployments before Vault is installed (Stage 5 §5.4).

---

### 0.5 — Deploy ClearLedger (layer by layer)

Deploy in **six layers**. Finish each layer before starting the next. Run `kubectl get pods -n clearledger` after layers 2, 3, and 6 to confirm progress.

**Prerequisite:** `export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-username` from §0.3 (must match the images you pushed).

Set a short path variable for the Stage 0 deployment files:

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-username   # skip if already set in §0.3
STAGE0=stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/infra/manifests
```

---

#### 0.5.1 — Layer 1: Namespace and RBAC

Nothing else can be created until the namespace exists. RBAC must exist before workloads reference ServiceAccounts.

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/rbac/rbac.yaml
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get namespace clearledger
kubectl get serviceaccount -n clearledger
# Expected: auth-service, ledger-service, notification-service, clearledger-viewer
```

---

#### 0.5.2 — Layer 2: PostgreSQL

The database must be running before auth-service or ledger-service start — both services connect to Postgres on startup to run migrations and serve requests, and they will crash-loop if the database is not there yet.

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/postgres/postgres-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/postgres/postgres.yaml

kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=postgres \
  -n clearledger --timeout=120s
```

Expected after `kubectl apply`:

```
secret/postgres-secret created
persistentvolumeclaim/postgres-pvc created
statefulset.apps/postgres created
service/postgres created
```

Expected when `kubectl wait` succeeds: the command exits with no output (exit code 0). If it times out, see **If postgres stays Pending** below before continuing.

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=postgres
kubectl get pvc -n clearledger
```

Expected:

```
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-0   1/1     Running   0          45s

NAME           STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS        AGE
postgres-pvc   Bound    pvc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   5Gi        RWO            microk8s-hostpath    45s
```

**If postgres stays Pending** (`kubectl wait` times out, pod shows `0/1 Pending`, PVC shows `Pending`):

Postgres needs a **PersistentVolumeClaim** — disk space on the cluster. MicroK8s provides that through the **`hostpath-storage`** addon. If `make setup` was interrupted or you used manual setup without `microk8s enable storage`, the PVC has nothing to bind to and the pod never schedules.

Check the events — you'll usually see something like:

```
Warning  FailedScheduling  ...  pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims
Normal   FailedBinding     ...  no persistent volumes available for this claim and no storage class is set
```

Fix it on the VM, then restart the postgres pod. Run this **from your host** — the same command on macOS, Linux, or Windows PowerShell (Multipass is installed on the host; it executes inside the VM for you):

```bash
# Enable storage (and ingress/rbac if make setup skipped them)
multipass exec clearledger -- microk8s enable storage ingress rbac

# Confirm a default StorageClass exists
kubectl get storageclass
# Expected: microk8s-hostpath (default)

# Kick the pod so it reschedules against the new storage class
kubectl delete pod postgres-0 -n clearledger

kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=postgres \
  -n clearledger --timeout=120s
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=postgres
# Expected: postgres-0   1/1   Running
```

Do not continue to auth-service or ledger-service until postgres is `Running` — they will crash-loop without a database.

---

#### 0.5.3 — Layer 3: Redis

**Why Redis is here — a quick scenario.** Imagine a customer posts a $15,000 debit. Ledger-service saves it to Postgres, then publishes a message to Redis: *"large transaction, user X, amount 15000."* Notification-service is listening on that channel. It picks up the message and records a compliance alert — the one you'll see in the UI later when you curl `/notifications/alerts`.

Ledger-service and notification-service don't call each other directly. Redis sits in the middle as a **message bus**: ledger publishes, notification subscribes. That's why Redis must be running before you deploy notification-service (and why you deploy it now, alongside Postgres, before the app layer).

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/redis/redis.yaml
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=redis
```

Expected:

```
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

---

#### 0.5.4 — Layer 4: Application secrets

Credentials live in Kubernetes Secrets for Stage 0 (Stage 5 moves them to Vault).

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/ledger-service/secret.yaml
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get secrets -n clearledger | grep -E 'auth-service|ledger-service'
```

Expected (AGE will differ; **DATA** counts must match):

```
auth-service-secret     Opaque   2      64s
ledger-service-secret   Opaque   1      8s
```

`auth-service-secret` holds two keys (`database_url`, `jwt_secret`). `ledger-service-secret` holds one (`database_url`). Stage 5 replaces these with Vault, for now they live in the cluster as Kubernetes Secrets.

---

#### 0.5.5 — Layer 5: Application workloads

You're about to start the four app services: auth, ledger, notification, and frontend. Postgres, Redis, and the Secrets from the last two layers are already in place — now Kubernetes needs to pull your Docker Hub images and run them as pods.

**Two files per service (mostly).** A **Deployment** tells Kubernetes *which container image to run* and *how many copies*. A **Service** gives that app a stable name inside the cluster (e.g. `auth-service` → so ledger can find auth without knowing pod IP addresses). You apply the Deployment first, then the Service.

**Why the `sed` command?** The deployment YAML files in Git contain a placeholder — literally the text `DOCKER_USERNAME` — because everyone's Docker Hub username is different. You already set yours in §0.3 (`export DOCKER_USERNAME=YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`). The `sed` line swaps that placeholder for your real username **on the fly**, as the manifest is sent to Kubernetes. You never edit the file in Git. If you skip `sed` and apply the raw file, Kubernetes tries to pull an image called `DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service` — which does not exist.

**Why files under `stages/stage-0-raw-kubernetes/`?** Stage 0 deployments read secrets from Kubernetes (`secretKeyRef`). The copies under `infra/manifests/` are for GitOps later — using those too early is a common mistake (see the CrashLoop note in **Verify** below). The `STAGE0=...` variable from the top of §0.5 points at the right folder.

Deploy each service in order. Run these from the repo root with `DOCKER_USERNAME` still exported:

**1. auth-service** — login and registration

```bash
sed "s|DOCKER_USERNAME|${DOCKER_USERNAME}|g" \
  "$STAGE0/auth-service/deployment.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/auth-service/service.yaml
```

**2. ledger-service** — transactions and balance (needs Postgres + the secret you created in §0.5.4)

```bash
sed "s|DOCKER_USERNAME|${DOCKER_USERNAME}|g" \
  "$STAGE0/ledger-service/deployment.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/ledger-service/service.yaml
```

**3. notification-service** — listens on Redis for large-transaction alerts (no database secret in this one)

```bash
sed "s|DOCKER_USERNAME|${DOCKER_USERNAME}|g" \
  "$STAGE0/notification-service/deployment.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/notification-service/service.yaml
```

**4. frontend** — the web UI (Deployment and Service are in one file here)

```bash
sed "s|DOCKER_USERNAME|${DOCKER_USERNAME}|g" \
  "$STAGE0/frontend/deployment.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
```

**Verify** (all app pods should reach `Running` — auth and ledger may take ~30s while they connect to Postgres):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger
```

Expected — you should see postgres and redis from earlier layers **plus** new pods for each app (exact pod names vary):

```
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-0                                1/1     Running   0          15m
redis-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx                    1/1     Running   0          10m
auth-service-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          45s
auth-service-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          45s
ledger-service-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx           1/1     Running   0          40s
ledger-service-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx           1/1     Running   0          40s
notification-service-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx     1/1     Running   0          35s
frontend-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx                 1/1     Running   0          30s
```

If auth-service or ledger-service is `CrashLoopBackOff`, check logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n clearledger deploy/auth-service --tail=20
```

Common cause: you applied `infra/manifests/*/deployment.yaml` instead of the Stage 0 files above — logs may show `DATABASE_URL is not set`. Re-run the `sed` + `kubectl apply` commands in this section.

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — workloads before ingress**

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n clearledger
kubectl get pods -n clearledger --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
```

Expected: four Deployments (`auth-service`, `ledger-service`, `notification-service`, `frontend`) with `READY` matching desired replicas (auth and ledger show `2/2`). The second command prints **nothing** — no pods stuck in Pending or CrashLoopBackOff.

---

#### 0.5.6 — Layer 6: Ingress

Exposes the cluster to `http://clearledger.local`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/ingress.yaml
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n clearledger
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/
# Expected: 200
```

---

#### 0.5.7 — Watch until stable

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -w
```

Expected final state (press Ctrl+C to stop watching once all pods show `Running`):

```
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS
auth-service-xxx                      1/1     Running   0
auth-service-yyy                      1/1     Running   0

Pod stuck in `Pending` or `CrashLoopBackOff`? These two commands show you what went wrong:

```bash
kubectl describe pod POD_NAME -n clearledger
kubectl logs POD_NAME -n clearledger --previous

### 0.6 — Verify the running system

Use **one test account** for both browser and curl so nothing conflicts:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `test@clearledger.io` |
| Password | `SecurePass123` |

If you already registered in the browser with a **different** password, either sign in with that password or pick a new email — the curl commands below must use the **same** email and password you actually registered with.

**Browser verification (recommended):**

Open `http://clearledger.local` in your browser. You should see the ClearLedger login screen.

1. Click **Register** and create an account with **`test@clearledger.io`** / **`SecurePass123`** (same as the curl block below — Pydantic rejects obviously fake emails like `test@test.com`)
2. Sign in with that email and password
3. On first login the dashboard auto-seeds demo transactions — wait a few seconds for them to appear
4. Look at the **Current Balance** card — it should show a dollar amount with a sparkline chart
5. Look at **Transaction History** — you should see entries like "Salary — Acme Corp", "Rent — May 2026", etc.
6. Look at the **Alerts** panel at the bottom — you should see `LARGE_TRANSACTION` alerts with a red badge. Two of the demo transactions exceed $10,000, which triggers the compliance alert automatically
7. Submit your own transaction over $10,000 — watch the alert count increase in real time

**What to look for:**

- Balance updates immediately after each transaction
- Credits show as green `+$` amounts, debits show as red `−$` amounts
- The Alerts badge count increases when you submit a transaction ≥ $10,000
- Each alert shows the amount, direction, and timestamp

**Take a screenshot of the dashboard showing transactions and at least one alert.** This is the first piece of your portfolio.

**Alternatively via curl** (same account — useful if the browser is not cooperating):

```bash
# Register (skip if you already registered in the browser with the same email)
curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@clearledger.io","password":"SecurePass123"}' | jq .
```

Expected: `{"user_id":"...","email":"test@clearledger.io"}` — or an error that the email is already registered (fine if you used the browser first).

```bash
# Login — save the token (must match the password you registered with)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@clearledger.io","password":"SecurePass123"}' \
  | jq -r .access_token)
echo "Token: ${TOKEN:0:30}..."
```

If `TOKEN` is empty or login returns `401`, your browser password does not match — re-register with the table above or use your actual password in the `-d` JSON.

```bash
# Create a large transaction (triggers notification alert)
curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/ledger/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":15000,"direction":"debit","description":"Property payment"}' | jq .
```

Expected: a transaction object with `id`, `amount: 15000`, `direction: "debit"`

```bash
# Check balance
curl -s http://clearledger.local/ledger/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .
```

```bash
# Confirm the notification alert fired for the authenticated user
curl -s http://clearledger.local/notifications/alerts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .
```

Expected (curl-only path, no browser demo seed): at least one alert for the $15,000 transaction — e.g. `{"total":1,"alerts":[{"type":"LARGE_TRANSACTION","amount":15000,...}]}`. If you already used the browser, `total` may be **3 or more** (two demo alerts plus yours) — that is also correct.

> **If you see `{"detail":"Unauthorized"}`:** your token has expired. JWTs are short-lived for security — this is intentional. Re-run the login command above to get a fresh token, then retry the failed command. This only affects the `$TOKEN` variable in your current terminal session. If you open a new terminal, you need to run the login command again because `$TOKEN` does not persist across sessions.

```bash
make check-0
```

### 0.7 — Why manual deploys can't be trusted

You already built, pushed, and deployed by hand in Stage 0. This section does it once more with a small code change so you can watch a rollout end to end. The goal is not to learn a good process — it is to notice what manual deploys *don't* give you: an audit trail, a reliable rollback, or proof of what is actually running. Stages 1 and 2 exist to fix those gaps.

**Step 1 — Make a visible change.**

Open `app/auth-service/main.py` and find the `/health` endpoint. Change the return value so you can tell the new version is running:

```python
# Before
return {"status": "ok", "service": settings.service_name}

# After — add a version field
return {"status": "ok", "service": settings.service_name, "version": "0.2.0"}
```

Save the file. This simulates a developer shipping a small fix.

**Step 2 — Build, push, and deploy by hand.**

```bash
docker build -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.2.0 ./app/auth-service
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.2.0
kubectl set image deployment/auth-service \
  auth-service=$DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.2.0 \
  -n clearledger
```

Wait about 30 seconds for Kubernetes to pull the new image and restart the pods:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/auth-service -n clearledger
```

**Step 3 — Verify your change is live.**

```bash
curl -s http://clearledger.local/auth/health | jq .
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok","service":"auth-service","version":"0.2.0"}`

If you still see the old response without `"version"`, wait a few more seconds and retry — Kubernetes is still rolling out the new pods.

**Step 4 — Notice what manual deploy doesn't give you.**

You deployed a change. It works. But think about what just happened:

- **Who deployed this?** There is no record. You ran `kubectl` from your laptop. If three people have cluster access, no one knows who changed what.
- **What changed?** The only evidence is the Docker Hub tag `v0.2.0`. Nothing links that tag to a specific commit or code review.
- **What if `v0.2.0` is broken?** You would need to remember the previous tag, then run `kubectl set image` again to roll back. What if you do not remember the tag? What if the previous image was deleted?
- **What if someone else runs `kubectl apply` with `v0.1.0` while you are pushing `v0.2.0`?** The cluster silently reverts to the old version. No error. No notification. You think your fix is live, but it is not.
- **Where is the audit trail?** Nowhere. In a regulated environment (banking, healthcare, government), you need proof of who deployed what and when. Right now you have nothing.

Manual deploys can work for a demo. They don't hold up for a team or a regulated environment. Keep these gaps in mind — they are why the next stages exist.

**Step 5 — Revert your change before continuing.**

Undo the health endpoint change in `app/auth-service/main.py` (remove `"version": "0.2.0"`). Do not rebuild — the cluster will keep running `v0.2.0` for now, and Stage 1 will take over image management.

Stage 1 automates the build. Stage 2 fixes the deployment.

### What you learned in Stage 0

- How to provision a local Kubernetes cluster with Multipass and MicroK8s
- How Kubernetes manifests describe the desired state of your system
- How an Ingress routes external traffic to internal services
- How to build, push, and deploy container images manually
- **Why manual deploys can't be trusted** — no audit trail, no rollback, no consistency

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Deployed a multi-service application to Kubernetes by hand — namespace, RBAC, a StatefulSet database, Deployments, Services, and path-based Ingress routing — and can explain why each layer deploys in that order.

**Save your VM before Stage 1.** This lab runs for days. Your Git repo on the Mac/Linux/Windows host survives a broken VM — Postgres data, deployed pods, and in-cluster config do not. After `make check-0` passes:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=0
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage0 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=0`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 1 — CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions + Self-Hosted Runner)

> In Stage 0 you built and deployed by hand. Stage 1 automates the build side: a `git push` runs a pipeline that produces images and updates your infra repo on GitHub. The cluster still does not change on its own — that is what Stage 2 (GitOps) fixes.

**Goal:** every push to GitHub automatically builds images, pushes them to Docker Hub, and updates image tags in `clearledger-infra`. You still apply changes to the cluster yourself for now — one problem solved, cluster drift remains until ArgoCD.

> **Am I ready for Stage 1?**
>
> Run these **yourself** before §1.1:
>
> ```bash
> make check-0
> echo "$DOCKER_USERNAME"    # must not be empty or "your-username"
> curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://clearledger.local/auth/health
> ```
>
> Expected: health check green; `echo` prints your Docker Hub user; curl prints `200`.
>
> - [ ] Docker Hub account with four `clearledger-*` repositories (see [QUICKSTART.md §1b](../QUICKSTART.md#step-1b--docker-hub-setup-required-before-stage-1))
> - [ ] GitHub account; you can create repos and personal access tokens
> - [ ] ~2–4 hours for runner install + first green pipeline (this is the hardest stage for beginners)
>
> **Done when:** `make check-1` passes **and** you manually confirmed the five items in §1.6 below.
> **Then save:** `make snapshot STAGE=1` → `make snapshots` (confirm `clearledger.stage1`).

### What you need to know first

In Stage 0, your laptop was the deployment system.

You typed `docker build`, `docker push`, and `kubectl set image` yourself. That worked for a demo, but it is not how teams should ship software. Manual builds create too many unanswered questions:

- Did this image come from the latest code?
- Did someone build it from a dirty working tree?
- Did the build work the same way on another machine?
- Which commit produced the image currently running?
- Who pushed the image, and when?

**CI (Continuous Integration)** fixes the build side of that problem. It means: every time code is pushed, an automated system builds, checks, and packages it the same way every time.

Think of CI as a factory line:

```text
Developer pushes code
        ↓
GitHub detects the push
        ↓
GitHub Actions starts the pipeline
        ↓
Runner executes the jobs
        ↓
Docker images are built and pushed
        ↓
Infra manifests are updated with the new image tags  (in clearledger-infra — §1.3)
```

The important idea: **the build no longer depends on your laptop**. Your laptop writes code. The pipeline produces the release artifact.

A CI system has three parts:

1. **Pipeline host** — the control plane. It notices a push and decides which workflow to run. In this lab, that is **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Pipeline file** — the instructions. It is a YAML file at `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` that says what jobs to run.
3. **Runner** — the worker machine. It actually executes the commands in the pipeline.

GitHub Actions normally uses GitHub-hosted runners in the cloud. In this lab, that is not enough. Your Kubernetes cluster lives inside a local Multipass VM. GitHub's cloud runner cannot reach it. You also need the runner inside the VM to build Docker images using the local Docker daemon.

So you install a **self-hosted runner** inside the VM. It connects outbound to GitHub, waits for work, then executes pipeline jobs locally where it can reach everything.

**Two GitHub repos — introduced here, created in §1.3.** Stage 0 used manifests from this repo on your laptop. Stage 1 splits things in two: **`clearledger`** (app code + `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) and **`clearledger-infra`** (Kubernetes YAML only — the “what should be running” contract). You have not created the second repo yet; that is §1.3. For now, just know CI will push image tag updates there after each successful build — it never runs `kubectl`.

```text
GitHub — clearledger (app repo)
  stores your code
  starts the workflow on git push
        ↓
Self-hosted runner (inside Multipass VM)
  builds Docker images
  pushes images to Docker Hub
  updates image tags in clearledger-infra  ← second repo; you create it in §1.3
        ↓
GitHub — clearledger-infra (infra repo)
  stores Kubernetes YAML with the new image tags
  ArgoCD watches this repo in Stage 2 (not yet)
```

Both repos live on GitHub. The runner is the only piece that runs locally — and it only needs outbound internet access to GitHub and Docker Hub.

> **Stages 1–7 vs Stage 8 — two pipelines, one repo.** This chapter uses `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` on your **self-hosted** runner (Docker Hub → `clearledger-infra`). Stage 8 adds a second workflow, `.github/workflows/ci-aws.yaml`, that runs on **GitHub-hosted** `ubuntu-latest` runners (ECR → in-repo kustomization). Fresh starters **do not** set anything extra — homelab CI is the default until you opt into AWS in §8. See [§8 — CI routing and `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET`](#ci-routing-stages-17-vs-stage-8).

This stage intentionally stops before automatic deployment. After the pipeline runs, the infra repo has changed, but the cluster has not — CI does not run `kubectl` in Stage 1 (the ArgoCD refresh step is **off** until you set repository variable `ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC=true` in Stage 2). That unfinished handoff is the lesson: **CI automates building; GitOps automates applying.** Stage 1 gives you CI. Stage 2 adds GitOps.

---

### 1.1 — Push the app repo to GitHub (not `clearledger-infra` yet)

This step is **repo #1 — `clearledger`** (application code + CI workflow). You are pushing the clone on your laptop — the same folder where you ran Stage 0 (`make setup`, `kubectl apply`, etc.).

**`clearledger-infra` comes later in §1.3.** That second repo holds Kubernetes manifests only. Do not create it here.

First, put the application repo somewhere GitHub Actions can see it.

Go to GitHub → **New Repository**:

- Repository name: **`clearledger`** (exact name — not `clearledger-infra`)
- Visibility: **Public or Private** — both work with the self-hosted runner and GitHub Actions. ArgoCD never reads this repo (see [Private repos — what syncs where](#private-repos--what-syncs-where) in §1.3).
- Do **not** initialize with a README or `.gitignore`

The repo already has those files locally. If GitHub creates its own, your first push may fail because the histories do not match.

Run from your **local `clearledger` project root** on your Mac (where `app/`, `infra/`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` live):

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/personal-projects/devsecops/clearledger   # your clone path
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If `git remote add` fails because `origin` already exists:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger.git
git push -u origin main
```

Verify in the browser: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger`.

You should see `app/`, `infra/manifests/`, `docs/`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. That confirms GitHub can trigger the pipeline on your next push.

**What you proved:** the **app repo** is on GitHub. CI will run from here. Deployment manifests for GitOps land in **`clearledger-infra`** in §1.3.

### 1.2 — Install the Self-Hosted Runner Inside the VM

The workflow file tells GitHub *what* to run. The runner is *where* it runs.

This lab uses a self-hosted runner because your infrastructure is local. GitHub's cloud servers cannot reach your MicroK8s cluster or Docker daemon inside the Multipass VM. The runner solves that by living inside the VM — it connects outbound to GitHub to pick up jobs, then executes everything locally.

```
GitHub (cloud) — clearledger app repo
  sees the git push
  schedules a workflow job
  ↓
Self-hosted runner (inside VM)
  receives the job
  builds Docker images
  pushes images to Docker Hub
  updates image tags in clearledger-infra  ← §1.3 creates this repo
```

If the runner is missing or offline, the pipeline cannot execute. The workflow may sit queued, or it may fail because no matching runner is available.

**Step 1 — Open GitHub’s runner setup page (keep this tab open)**

GitHub gives you a full copy-paste install guide on one page. Use it — don’t hunt for URLs or tokens elsewhere.

1. Open **`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger`**
2. **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners** → **New self-hosted runner**
3. Check the VM architecture first:
   ```bash
   multipass exec clearledger -- uname -m
   ```
   Select **Linux** and then choose **ARM64** for `aarch64`/`arm64`, or
   **x64** for `x86_64`. The runner architecture must match the VM.

The page title should look like: **Add new self-hosted runner · YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger**.

That page has three sections you will use:

| Section on GitHub | What to do with it |
|---|---|
| **Download** | Copy the `mkdir`, `curl`, and `tar` commands into the VM in Step 4 (same versions as below) |
| **Configure** | Copy the **token** from the `./config.sh ... --token ...` line — do **not** run GitHub’s `./config.sh` as-is |
| **Using your self-hosted runner** | Ignore for now — the lab workflow needs the `clearledger` label (Step 4) |

Scroll to **Configure**. You will see something like:

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger --token AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
./run.sh
```

**The token is the long string after `--token`** (starts with `A`, about 26 characters). Copy **only** that string.

Keep this tab open until Step 4 finishes — the token expires in about **1 hour**. If it expires, click **New self-hosted runner** again for a fresh token.

**Step 2 — Enter the VM**

```bash
multipass shell clearledger
```

> **STOP. Check your prompt before continuing.**
>
> After running `multipass shell clearledger`, your terminal prompt should change to something like:
> ```
> ubuntu@clearledger:~$
> ```
> If your prompt still shows your Mac username (e.g. `mac@192` or `yourname@MacBook`), you are still on your host machine.
> The runner binary is compiled for Linux. Running it on macOS will fail with:
> `cannot execute binary file`
>
> Do not proceed until your prompt shows `ubuntu@clearledger`.

**Everything from Step 3 onwards runs inside the VM, not on your Mac.**

**Step 3 — Install Docker inside the VM**

The runner will build Docker images. That means Docker must exist where the runner runs.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker

docker --version
```

Expected: Docker prints a version number (e.g. `Docker version 29.x.x`).

**Verify Docker works for the `ubuntu` user now** — the runner does not exist yet (Step 4 creates `~/actions-runner`):

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected: a table header (CONTAINER ID, IMAGE, …) — even if no containers are listed. **Not** `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker API`.

If `docker ps` fails with permission denied, the `docker` group has not applied yet. Run `newgrp docker` again, or log out of the VM (`exit`) and `multipass shell clearledger` back in, then retry `docker ps`.

What you proved: the VM can run Docker without Docker Desktop on your Mac. Continue to Step 4 to install the runner.

**Step 4 — Install and register the runner**

Still inside the VM (`ubuntu@clearledger` prompt).

**Download:** use the architecture selected on GitHub’s runner page in Step 1,
or run the architecture-aware block below. Paste it into the VM, not your Mac.

**Configure:** use the lab command below, not GitHub’s `./config.sh` line. Paste your token from Step 1 and replace `YOUR_USERNAME`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/actions-runner && cd ~/actions-runner

RUNNER_VERSION="2.336.0"
case "$(uname -m)" in
  aarch64|arm64)
    RUNNER_ARCH="arm64"
    RUNNER_SHA256="58b758e420b87093fbd4bfddd368074960053e2f1388f01848c82624b90f27d1"
    ;;
  x86_64)
    RUNNER_ARCH="x64"
    RUNNER_SHA256="04cf0be1aff4c3ec3554466c39124ca250e3effd8873bb7e8d68535aa9505d5d"
    ;;
  *) echo "Unsupported runner architecture: $(uname -m)" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac
RUNNER_TARBALL="actions-runner-linux-${RUNNER_ARCH}-${RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz"

curl -fL -o "${RUNNER_TARBALL}" \
  "https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v${RUNNER_VERSION}/${RUNNER_TARBALL}"

echo "${RUNNER_SHA256}  ${RUNNER_TARBALL}" | sha256sum --check
tar xzf "${RUNNER_TARBALL}"

./config.sh \
  --url https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger \
  --token YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN \
  --name clearledger-runner \
  --labels clearledger,self-hosted,linux \
  --work _work \
  --unattended

sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

Do **not** run GitHub’s `./run.sh` for day-to-day use — the lab uses `sudo ./svc.sh` so the runner survives VM reboots. GitHub shows `./run.sh` for a quick test only.

Expected after `./config.sh`: `Runner successfully added` (or similar). If you see **Invalid token** or **Expired token**, go back to Step 1 in the browser and copy a fresh token.

The **`clearledger` label is required** — GitHub’s default `./config.sh` on the setup page does not add it. The workflow uses:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, clearledger]
```

GitHub schedules jobs by runner **labels**, not by runner name. A runner named `clearledger` without the `clearledger` label will stay online but jobs will remain queued with `Waiting for a runner to pick up this job`.

What those last two commands mean:

```text
sudo ./svc.sh install
  Registers the runner with systemd inside the VM.
  Without this, `sudo ./svc.sh status` says: not installed.

sudo ./svc.sh start
  Starts the runner service in the background.
  After this, it keeps running even when you close the terminal.
```

Check it locally from the same folder, still inside the VM:

```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

Expected: the service is installed and running.

**If `docker ps` worked in Step 3 but a CI job later fails with Docker socket permission denied**, the runner probably started before the `docker` group applied. Restart it **after** Step 4 (only when `~/actions-runner` exists):

```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh stop
sudo ./svc.sh start
docker ps    # must work without sudo
```

Or, if you started the runner manually with `./run.sh` instead of systemd:

```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
pkill -f "Runner.Listener|Runner.Worker|./run.sh" || true
nohup ./run.sh > _diag/manual-runner.log 2>&1 &
docker ps
```

If you see this:

```text
not installed
```

then `sudo ./svc.sh install` did not run successfully. Run:

```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

If `install` fails, rerun `./config.sh` with a fresh GitHub runner token, then run the install/start commands again.

**Step 5 — Exit the VM**

```bash
exit
```

**Step 6 — Verify the runner is connected**

Go to: github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger → Settings → Actions → Runners

You should see `clearledger-runner` with a green dot and status **Idle**. Open the runner details and confirm the labels include:

```text
self-hosted
Linux
X64
clearledger
```

If `clearledger` is missing, add it in the runner settings before rerunning the workflow. The runner name alone is not enough.

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — runner ready for jobs**

Still on GitHub → Settings → Actions → Runners, confirm:

| Field | Expected |
|---|---|
| Status | **Idle** (green) |
| Labels | includes `self-hosted` **and** `clearledger` |
| OS | Linux |

Then trigger a dry run from your laptop (no code change needed):

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: verify runner picks up jobs"
git push
```

Open `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger/actions` — within 30 seconds a workflow run should show **Queued** then **In progress**, not stuck on “Waiting for a runner.” If it waits more than 2 minutes, the labels are wrong — edit the runner on GitHub and add `clearledger`.

If it shows Offline:

```bash
multipass exec clearledger -- sudo systemctl status actions.runner.*.service
multipass exec clearledger -- journalctl -u actions.runner.*.service --lines=50
```

What you proved: GitHub can now send work into your local lab environment.

### 1.3 — Create the Infra Repo on GitHub

Now separate **application code** from **deployment state**. Stage 1 introduces a second GitHub repository alongside the `clearledger` app repo you pushed in §1.1.

You will use two repositories for the rest of the lab:

| Repo | What lives there | Who changes it | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clearledger` | App source code, Dockerfiles, tests, `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, lab docs | You, the developer | This is where code changes start |
| `clearledger-infra` | Kubernetes manifests only: `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, ingress, secrets templates | The CI pipeline, then ArgoCD reads it | This is the desired state of the cluster |

Think of **`clearledger`** as the question *“What is the application?”* — Python services, Dockerfiles, tests, and the CI workflow. Think of **`clearledger-infra`** as *“What exact version should be running in Kubernetes right now?”* — Deployments, Services, ingress rules, and the image tags that point at Docker Hub.

Teams split these on purpose. If you edit `README.md` in `clearledger`, that is a documentation change; it should not trigger a deployment. If you change `auth-service` code, the pipeline builds a new image (for example tag `abc123`) and, only after scans pass, records that tag in `clearledger-infra`:

```yaml
image: $DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:abc123
```

That line is a **deployment contract**: Git now says the cluster *should* run `abc123`. In Stage 1, the cluster does not change yet — you will prove that in §1.6. In **Stage 2**, ArgoCD watches `clearledger-infra`, compares Git to what is running, and syncs the cluster when they differ. The app repo is where work begins; the infra repo is what production is supposed to look like.

The full path looks like this:

```text
You push code to clearledger
        ↓
GitHub Actions builds and scans Docker images
        ↓
Images are pushed to Docker Hub
        ↓
The pipeline updates image tags in clearledger-infra
        ↓
Stage 2: ArgoCD reads clearledger-infra and deploys to the cluster
```

#### Private repos — what syncs where

Learners often make **`clearledger` private** (good practice). That does **not** break the lab — but it confuses people because there are two repos with different jobs.

| Repo | Typical visibility | Who needs access | What it is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`clearledger`** | Private OK | You, GitHub Actions (self-hosted runner) | App code, CI, Kyverno policies (`infra/policies/`), lab docs |
| **`clearledger-infra`** | **Public recommended** | ArgoCD, CI (`INFRA_REPO_TOKEN`) | Kubernetes manifests only — ArgoCD's source of truth |

**ArgoCD never clones `clearledger`.** It only watches **`clearledger-infra`**. Making the app repo private does not cause `ComparisonError` — that error means ArgoCD cannot read **`clearledger-infra`** (usually private infra repo without `argocd repo add`, or an expired PAT).

**How `clearledger` becomes `clearledger-infra` (the sync chain):**

```text
clearledger/infra/manifests/          ← canonical YAML in the app repo
        ↓  (every green CI run on main, or make push-infra-manifests)
clearledger-infra/manifests/ on GitHub ← desired cluster state
        ↓  (ArgoCD poll ~3 min, or argocd app sync)
Kubernetes cluster                    ← what is actually running
```

**Automatic sync:** push to `clearledger` `main` → CI job **Update Manifests → GitHub** rsyncs `infra/manifests/` into `clearledger-infra` and pushes (uses `INFRA_REPO_TOKEN` secret).

**Manual sync** (same thing CI does — useful after editing manifests locally without a full pipeline run):

```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER=YOUR_USERNAME
export INFRA_REPO_TOKEN='ghp_...'          # same PAT as Stage 1 §1.4 — required if clearledger-infra is private
make push-infra-manifests GITHUB_OWNER="$GITHUB_OWNER"
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web     # optional nudge; ArgoCD polls on its own
```

**What does *not* sync to `clearledger-infra`:** Kyverno policies (`infra/policies/`), Cosign keys, Helm values for platform tools. Those live in `clearledger` and you apply them with `kubectl` / `helm` when each stage tells you to. Stage 4 §4.3 is `kubectl apply -f infra/policies/...` — not a Git push to the infra repo.

**Checklist if ArgoCD shows `ComparisonError` or stays OutOfSync:**

1. `argocd repo list --grpc-web` → `clearledger-infra` must be **Successful** (re-run `argocd repo add` with PAT if private).
2. Open `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra/tree/main/manifests` — files must exist.
3. `argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web` — or wait ~3 minutes for auto-poll.

See [troubleshooting.md — ComparisonError](troubleshooting.md#comparisonerror-authentication-required--repository-not-found).

The pipeline never runs `kubectl apply` on your app in Stage 1. It updates Git; GitOps (Stage 2) applies Git to the cluster.

**Create the infra repo on GitHub:** go to github.com → **New Repository** → name **`clearledger-infra`** → **Public** → **Create** (do not add a README — you will push manifests from your laptop).

> **Why Public?** ArgoCD must clone this repo on every sync. A **private** repo works too, but only if you register your GitHub PAT with ArgoCD in Stage 2 (`argocd repo add`). If you skip that step, the Argo CD UI shows **`ComparisonError: authentication required: Repository not found`** — GitHub hides private repos from anonymous access. Most learners should use **Public** for the infra repo and keep secrets out of it (app secrets live in `secret.yaml` until Stage 5 removes them from Git).

**Before pushing:** set your Docker Hub username in Kustomize (image tags are resolved here, not in deployment YAML):

```bash
# Replace YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME with the same value as $DOCKER_USERNAME from §0.3
sed -i.bak "s/YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/${DOCKER_USERNAME}/g" infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml
rm -f infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml.bak
```

Push only the Kubernetes manifests from `infra/manifests/` (not everything under `infra/`):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/clearledger-infra
cp -r infra/manifests /tmp/clearledger-infra/
cd /tmp/clearledger-infra
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git
git add . && git commit -m "feat: initial manifests" && git push -u origin main
cd -
```

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — infra repo on GitHub (do this before §1.4)**

On your laptop:

```bash
grep "docker.io/${DOCKER_USERNAME}/" infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml | wc -l
grep YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml || echo "OK: placeholder replaced"
```

Expected: first command prints `4` (four image lines). Second prints `OK: placeholder replaced` — not four lines still saying `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`.

In the browser, open `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra/tree/main/manifests` and confirm **with your eyes**:

| File / folder | Must exist |
|---|---|
| `kustomization.yaml` | Yes — open it; `newName:` lines use **your** Docker Hub user |
| `auth-service/secret.yaml` | Yes — Stages 2–4 need this until Stage 5 |
| `ledger-service/secret.yaml` | Yes |
| `auth-service/deployment.yaml` | Yes — open it; must contain `secretKeyRef`, **not** `vault.hashicorp.com` |
| `netpol/` | **No** — if present, delete the folder on GitHub before Stage 2 |
| `vault/` | **No** — Vault rotation is Stage 5 only |

**Which folders matter?** You only pushed **`infra/manifests/`** to GitHub — that is correct. Everything else in this repo stays local for now. Some manifests for later stages (network policies, Vault extras) live under **`infra/deferred-by-stage/`** in the **`clearledger`** repo; you apply those by hand when you reach that stage — do **not** copy that folder into `clearledger-infra`, or ArgoCD would deploy things too early.

You might notice `stages/stage-1-ci-pipeline/` has no copy of the manifests. That is normal — the lab does not duplicate YAML there. The canonical copy is **`infra/manifests/`** in this repo, and the live GitOps copy is **`clearledger-infra`** on GitHub.

**What you proved:** Kubernetes config now has its own repo and Git history, separate from application code. CI will update `clearledger-infra` after each build; your app repo stays for code and the pipeline file.

### 1.4 — Set up GitHub Secrets

Go to: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger` → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

The workflow needs credentials for Docker Hub, GitHub, and image signing:

- Docker Hub, so it can push images.
- GitHub, so it can push image tag updates into `clearledger-infra`.
- Cosign, so it can sign the images after pushing them.

Do **not** paste these values into YAML files. Store them as GitHub Actions secrets.

**Secret 1 — `DOCKER_USERNAME`**

This is just your Docker Hub username.

Example:

```text
$DOCKER_USERNAME
```

Get it from Docker Hub: hub.docker.com → profile menu → Account Settings.

**Secret 2 — `DOCKER_PASSWORD`**

This should be a Docker Hub **access token**, not your normal Docker Hub password.

Create it here:

```text
hub.docker.com
→ Account Settings
→ Security
→ New Access Token
→ Description: clearledger-github-actions
→ Access permissions: Read, Write, Delete or Read/Write
→ Generate
```

Copy the token immediately. Docker Hub only shows it once.

**Secret 3 — `INFRA_REPO_TOKEN`**

This is a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). The pipeline uses it to push commits to the second repo, `clearledger-infra`.

Create it here:

```text
GitHub profile settings
→ Settings
→ Developer settings
→ Personal access tokens
→ Tokens (classic)
→ Click "Generate new token"
→ Choose "Generate new token (classic)"
→ If GitHub asks for your password or 2FA, complete it
→ Note: clearledger-infra-ci
→ Expiration: choose a lab-friendly value
→ Select scope: repo
   This allows the pipeline to push to clearledger-infra.
→ Generate token
```

Copy the token immediately. GitHub only shows it once.

For this lab, `repo` scope is the simplest option. In production, you would use tighter permissions, such as a fine-grained token limited to only `clearledger-infra`.

**Secrets 4 and 5 — `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` and `COSIGN_PASSWORD`**

Cosign signs container images after the pipeline pushes them to Docker Hub. Later, Stage 4 uses the public key with Kyverno so the cluster can verify that images came from your trusted pipeline.

Generate the key pair on your host machine, not inside the Multipass VM:

```bash
# macOS: brew install cosign
# Linux/WSL2: curl -sSL -o cosign https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/latest/download/cosign-linux-amd64 && chmod +x cosign && sudo mv cosign /usr/local/bin/
cosign generate-key-pair
```

This creates:

```text
cosign.key   # private key — never commit this
cosign.pub   # public key — keep for later Kyverno verification
```

When Cosign asks for a password, enter one and save it in your password manager. If you already generated a key without a password, regenerate it with a password for this lab.

Add these five secrets to the `clearledger` repo, not `clearledger-infra`:

| Secret name | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username | Pipeline logs in to push images |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Your Docker Hub access token | Pipeline authenticates with Docker Hub |
| `INFRA_REPO_TOKEN` | The GitHub PAT from above | Pipeline pushes image tag updates to clearledger-infra |
| `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of `cosign.key` | Pipeline signs pushed container images |
| `COSIGN_PASSWORD` | Password used when creating the Cosign key | Unlocks the private key during signing |

**Repository variables (not secrets)** — optional toggles for later stages. Add under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

| Variable | Stage 1 | When to enable |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC` | Leave **unset** | **Stage 2** — after ArgoCD’s first sync is healthy (see [Enable CI → ArgoCD handoff](#enable-ci--argocd-handoff-close-the-stage-1-deployment-gap)) |
| `ENABLE_DAST` | Leave **unset** | **Stage 3** — after the app is live at `clearledger.local` (see [Enable DAST](#enable-dast-optional--after-stage-2)) |

**Do not add either variable in Stage 1.** If you set them now, CI will try to refresh ArgoCD or run ZAP before the cluster is ready — and the pipeline output gets harder to read. The guide calls out the exact moment to turn each one on; you only need to remember that both exist.

What you proved: the pipeline can authenticate to external systems without hardcoding credentials in the repo.

### 1.5 — Understand the pipeline before activating it

Do not treat the workflow file as magic. Open `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` and read it before you run it.

The pipeline has two responsibilities:

1. Prove the code and images are safe enough to publish.
2. Update the infra repo with the new image tags.

Here is the security flow first:

```text
Developer pushes code to GitHub
        ↓
GitHub Actions starts workflow
        ↓
Self-hosted runner inside the Multipass VM picks up the job
        ↓
1. Scan secrets (Gitleaks)
        ↓
2. Run code security scans (Semgrep) + IaC scan (Checkov) — parallel
        ↓
3. Prepare scanners (install Trivy/Syft/Grype/Cosign once; refresh Trivy DB once)
        ↓
4. BUILD — docker build all four services (local tags only; nothing hits Docker Hub yet)
        ↓
5. SCAN — Trivy on all images; Syft + Grype SBOM on auth-service; upload evidence
        ↓
6. PUBLISH — push to Docker Hub + Cosign sign (only if scan passed)
        ↓
7. UPDATE MANIFESTS — commit new image tags to clearledger-infra
```

#### Build → scan → publish (prod-style gates)

Real teams **never push first and scan later**. The pipeline separates three concerns into three jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`:

| Job | What it does | If it fails… |
|---|---|---|
| `build-images` | `docker build` all services with tag `${{ github.sha }}` | No registry pollution — images never left the runner |
| `scan-images` | Trivy (all 4 images); Syft + Grype (auth only) | Publish is skipped — bad images never reach Docker Hub |
| `publish-images` | Runs `scripts/ci-publish-image.sh` — tag, push, Cosign sign | Only runs after scan passes |

You do **not** run `scripts/ci-publish-image.sh` yourself before pushing code. GitHub Actions checks out the repo and calls it inside `publish-images`.

**Why can `build-images` and `scan-images` be separate jobs?** Each job is a fresh checkout on GitHub-hosted runners — they do not share a disk. On **your** self-hosted runner, all three jobs run on the **same Multipass VM** and use the **same Docker engine**. Job 1 runs `docker build` and leaves the images on that machine. Job 2 runs Trivy against those same local images — no upload, no download. Job 3 pushes to Docker Hub only if the scan passed.

That is a practical lab setup: one persistent build machine with Docker installed, like a dedicated CI worker in a real office. In **Stage 8 (AWS)**, the pipeline uses GitHub-hosted runners instead — there, `build-images` saves the images to a file (`images.tar`) and passes that file to the next job as a workflow artifact, because those runners are throwaway VMs with no shared Docker cache.

Then comes the GitOps handoff:

```text
Secure images now exist in Docker Hub
        ↓
Runner checks out clearledger-infra from GitHub
        ↓
Deployment YAML image tags are updated
        ↓
Runner commits and pushes back to clearledger-infra
        ↓
Stage 1 ends here
```

**How the image tag ties to your code:** every pipeline run is triggered by a git commit. GitHub gives that commit a unique ID called the **SHA** (a long hex string like `a1b2c3d4e5f6789…`). The workflow sets `IMAGE_TAG` to that SHA and uses it everywhere:

1. **Build** — `docker build -t clearledger-auth-service:a1b2c3d4…`
2. **Publish** — push to Docker Hub as `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:a1b2c3d4…`
3. **Update manifests** — `kustomize edit set image …:a1b2c3d4…` in `clearledger-infra`
4. **Commit message** — `ci: deploy a1b2c3d4… — all gates passed`

So if production is running `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:a1b2c3d4…`, you paste that tag into GitHub (`https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger/commit/a1b2c3d4…`) and see the **exact source code** that built it. No guessing, no “maybe it was `latest`”. That one-to-one link is why teams use commit SHAs instead of floating tags like `v0.1.0` for deploys.

#### GitOps manifest flow — three places, one chain

Three folders sound similar but do different jobs. Keep them straight:

- **`app/`** in **`clearledger`** — your Python/frontend code. You edit this when you change features or fix bugs.
- **`infra/manifests/`** in **`clearledger`** — Kubernetes YAML you write by hand (deployments, probes, limits, secrets layout). This is the template.
- **`clearledger-infra`** on GitHub — what the cluster should actually run. CI updates this after every green build. ArgoCD watches it from Stage 2 onward.

When you push code, the chain looks like this:

```text
You push app code (+ you may have edited infra/manifests/)
        ↓
CI builds images → scans → publishes to Docker Hub
        ↓
CI copies the full infra/manifests/ tree into clearledger-infra
        ↓
CI updates only the image tags in kustomization.yaml (Kustomize, not sed)
        ↓
Stage 2+: ArgoCD syncs the cluster to match Git
```

**The placeholder trick (read this slowly).**

`auth-service/deployment.yaml` does not say `docker.io/YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:abc123`. It says:

```yaml
image: clearledger/auth-service:gitops
```

That string is not a real image on Docker Hub — it is a **label** Kustomize recognizes. The real address lives in one other file, `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
images:
  - name: clearledger/auth-service          # matches the label in deployment.yaml
    newName: docker.io/YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service   # real registry path
    newTag: abc123def456…                                 # real version (commit SHA)
```

When ArgoCD deploys, it runs `kustomize build`. Kustomize reads both files and substitutes the label with `docker.io/YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:abc123…`.

**What you edit vs what CI edits**

You already edited `kustomization.yaml` once in §1.3 — you replaced `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` with your Docker Hub user in the `newName:` lines. That is a one-time setup step. You might edit the `resources:` list later when a new stage adds files (Vault in Stage 5, for example).

You do **not** update `newTag:` yourself after every git push. When CI passes, it writes the new commit SHA into `newTag:` for you. If you did that by hand on every deploy, you would eventually typo a tag and break production.

**Stage 1: CI updates GitHub, not the cluster**

After a green pipeline run, three things are true:

- New images exist on Docker Hub
- `clearledger-infra` on GitHub has new SHAs in `kustomization.yaml`
- Your Kubernetes cluster is **unchanged** — still running whatever Stage 0 left there

CI never runs `kubectl apply`. It only commits to `clearledger-infra`. That is the whole Stage 1 lesson: build and scan are automated, but **deploy** is not — yet. Stage 2 installs ArgoCD, which reads `clearledger-infra` and updates the cluster for you.

---

#### What each pipeline job does

Open `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` if you want the full detail. At a high level:

1. **Secrets / SAST / Dockerfile Checkov** — block bad commits early.
2. **`prepare-scanners`** — installs Trivy, Syft, Grype once per run (avoids re-downloading the CVE database for every service).
3. **`build-images`** — `docker build` all four services on the runner.
4. **`scan-images`** — Trivy + Grype; publish is skipped if CVEs fail the gate.
5. **`publish-images`** — push to Docker Hub and Cosign-sign (signing is non-blocking until Stage 4).
6. **`update-manifests`** — copy `infra/manifests/` into `clearledger-infra` and set image SHAs in `kustomization.yaml`.

Push to `main` triggers the workflow. Jobs run on your self-hosted runner (`runs-on: [self-hosted, clearledger]`) so they can reach the local Docker daemon and, from Stage 2, the cluster.

**Two toggles stay off until later** (see §1.4 — the guide tells you when to flip each):

- **`ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC`** — unset in Stage 1. The `update-manifests` job commits to `clearledger-infra` but does not nudge ArgoCD yet.
- **`ENABLE_DAST`** — unset until Stage 3, when the app is live at `clearledger.local`.

**Kubernetes Checkov** runs in Stage 1 but does **not** block the pipeline — it uploads findings so you can see hardening work ahead. Stage 4 turns those kinds of rules into cluster enforcement with Kyverno.

If a job fails, start with [`docs/troubleshooting.md#stage-1-ci-troubleshooting`](troubleshooting.md#stage-1-ci-troubleshooting) before editing the workflow.

---

#### Stage 1 security posture — what blocks vs what waits

Stage 1 is not “security off.” Some gates **stop the pipeline**; others **run for evidence** and tighten in later stages.

**Blocks the pipeline today**

- Gitleaks (secrets in Git)
- Semgrep (SAST on Python)
- Checkov on Dockerfiles
- Trivy (fixable HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs in images)
- Grype on auth-service SBOM (fixable HIGH+)
- Manifest update to `clearledger-infra` (must succeed)

**Runs but does not block yet**

- Checkov on Kubernetes manifests → enforced in **Stage 4** (Kyverno)
- Cosign sign + SLSA attest → enforced in **Stage 4** (unsigned images rejected)
- Syft SBOM generation → supply-chain evidence; you break gates on purpose in **Stage 3**
- ArgoCD refresh → **Stage 2** (`ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC=true`)
- DAST / ZAP → **Stage 3** (`ENABLE_DAST=true`)

**If you forget which stage fixes what**, search this guide for “Stage 1 security posture” or follow the stage order: Stage 3 breaks gates on purpose, Stage 4 connects Checkov findings to Kyverno, Stage 5 moves secrets off Git, Stage 6 adds runtime detection, Stage 7 adds dashboards. Run `make check-3` and `make check-4` after those stages to confirm hardening landed.

> **Design intent:** Stage 1 proves CI can build, scan, push, and update Git without you touching Docker manually. Later stages turn evidence into enforcement. The relaxations here are deliberate.

### 1.6 — Activate the pipeline

**Run this in the `clearledger` app repo — not `clearledger-infra`.**

§1.3 created `clearledger-infra` with only Kubernetes manifests. It has no `.github/workflows/` and no pipeline. If your shell prompt says `clearledger-infra`, or you used `/tmp/clearledger-infra`, you are in the wrong place.

```bash
cd /path/to/clearledger          # the app repo you pushed in §1.1
git remote -v                    # must show .../clearledger.git — NOT clearledger-infra
ls .github/workflows/ci.yaml     # must exist before you commit
```

The pipeline file already lives at `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. Push any small change to **`clearledger`** on `main`:

```bash
echo "# Pipeline activated $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "ci: activate GitHub Actions pipeline"
git push origin main
```

Watch the run at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger/actions` (app repo Actions tab — not the infra repo).

When the pipeline succeeds, it updates **`clearledger-infra`** for you. You do not need to push anything to the infra repo by hand for this step.

Expected: all jobs green in about 8 minutes.

```
✓ Build + Scan auth-service
✓ Build + Scan ledger-service
✓ Build + Scan notification-service
✓ Build + Scan frontend
✓ Update manifests → GitHub
```

You may also see **DAST (OWASP ZAP + fintech API tests)** listed as **skipped** — that is expected. DAST is off until you set the repository variable `ENABLE_DAST` to `true` (after Stage 2, when the app is deployed and reachable). A skipped DAST job is not a failure.

The **Trigger ArgoCD refresh** step inside `update-manifests` is also skipped in Stage 1 — that is expected. Do not enable `ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC` until Stage 2.

Note: this lab includes `.gitleaksignore` because some intentional demo secrets are already present in git history. Gitleaks still runs normally. The ignore file only suppresses known lab fingerprints. Do not add new findings to it unless you have confirmed they are intentional test data.

Click into the job logs and look for the story — do not just wait for green:

- Docker login succeeded
- Each service image built and pushed to Docker Hub
- `clearledger-infra` was checked out
- Deployment YAMLs were updated with the new SHA tag
- A commit was pushed back to `clearledger-infra`

After the pipeline succeeds, open `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra` and look at the deployment manifests. The image tags should now use the current commit SHA.

Now check the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get deployment auth-service -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}' && echo
```

You may still see the old image. That is expected. This is the most important learning in Stage 1:

```text
GitHub pipeline succeeded.
Docker Hub has new images.
clearledger-infra has new image tags.
The Kubernetes cluster did not update automatically.
```

That is not a failure. It is the deployment gap. Stage 1 automated the build, but no controller is watching the infra repo yet. Stage 2 installs ArgoCD to close that gap.

### 1.6 — Hands-on checkpoint: prove Stage 1 is really done

Do not rely on a green workflow badge alone. Run each check yourself:

**1 — Infra repo still has app secrets (critical for Stage 2)**

Open `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra/tree/main/manifests/auth-service` — `secret.yaml` must be visible.

On your laptop:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git /tmp/verify-infra
grep secretKeyRef /tmp/verify-infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml
grep secret.yaml /tmp/verify-infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml
rm -rf /tmp/verify-infra
```

Expected: `secretKeyRef` in deployment output; kustomization lists `auth-service/secret.yaml` and `ledger-service/secret.yaml`. If secrets are missing, re-push §1.3 manifests before Stage 2.

**2 — Kustomize image tags updated by CI**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git /tmp/verify-infra
grep newTag /tmp/verify-infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml
rm -rf /tmp/verify-infra
```

Expected: `newTag` is a **40-character git SHA** (or your commit hash), not still `v0.1.0` only — unless you have not pushed since §0.3.

**3 — Docker Hub has signed images from this pipeline**

Open hub.docker.com → `clearledger-auth-service` → **Tags** — latest tag should match the SHA from step 2.

**4 — Cluster unchanged (deployment gap — intentional)**

```bash
kubectl get deployment auth-service -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}' && echo
```

Expected: still your **Stage 0** tag (e.g. `$DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.1.0`), not the new SHA. That proves CI did not touch the cluster.

**5 — Runner still idle**

GitHub → Settings → Actions → Runners → `clearledger-runner` → **Idle**.

```bash
make check-1
```

All five pass → Stage 2.

### What you learned in Stage 1

- **CI removes your laptop from the build process.** Builds become repeatable, visible, and tied to Git commits.
- **A runner is the worker, not the pipeline itself.** GitHub schedules the job; the self-hosted runner executes it inside your VM.
- **Artifacts and desired state are different things.** Docker Hub stores built images. `clearledger-infra` on GitHub stores the Kubernetes manifests that say which image should run.
- **Good pipelines do not secretly mutate clusters.** This pipeline updates Git instead of running `kubectl`.
- **The gap that remains:** the infra repo changed, but the cluster did not. Someone still has to apply the change manually. Stage 2 fixes that with GitOps.

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Built a CI pipeline on a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner that builds and pushes container images on every push, and can debug a workflow that fails before any job is created.

### DevSecOps lesson — Stage 1 in one paragraph

**Automate the boring path first, and separate “built” from “deployed.”** Stage 1 turns `git push` into a repeatable factory: scan, build, sign, push images, then update **desired state** in `clearledger-infra` — not the cluster directly. That split is core DevSecOps: the pipeline produces **evidence** (scan reports, signed images, immutable tags tied to commit SHA) and records **intent** (which image *should* run) in Git. Security starts here too — some gates already block bad commits — but the deliberate lesson is operational: nobody SSHs to build, nobody runs `kubectl` to “deploy,” and when the infra repo changes but the cluster does not, you feel the **deployment gap** that Stage 2 closes. CI automates *building*; GitOps (next) automates *applying*.

**Save your VM before Stage 2.** After `make check-1` passes and §1.6 is done:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=1
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage1 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=1`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 2 — GitOps with ArgoCD

> **Git is truth.** The infra repo says what *should* run. **ArgoCD** keeps the cluster matching that and fixes drift on its own.

**Goal:** Install ArgoCD so it watches `clearledger-infra` and deploys to the cluster. CI still only updates Git; it never runs `kubectl`.

> **Am I ready for Stage 2?**
>
> Complete §1.6 first. Then run:
>
> ```bash
> make check-1
> grep secretKeyRef infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml
> grep vault.hashicorp infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml && echo "STOP: Vault annotations present" || echo "OK"
> ```
>
> Expected: check-1 green; `secretKeyRef` present; `OK` (no Vault annotations in Stages 2–4).
>

### What you need to know first

**The gap from Stage 1:** CI already builds images and updates `clearledger-infra`. The cluster did not change until someone ran `kubectl`. This stage closes that last step.

| Who | Job |
|---|---|
| **CI** (Stage 1) | Build → scan → push images → update image tags in `clearledger-infra` |
| **ArgoCD** (Stage 2) | Watch `clearledger-infra` → apply manifests → cluster runs what Git says |

```text
push code → CI updates clearledger-infra → ArgoCD syncs cluster
```

**GitOps** means the infra repo is the official record of what should run — not whatever the cluster happens to have right now. **ArgoCD** is the controller that enforces that inside Kubernetes. Push a new commit to Git and ArgoCD deploys it. Change something by hand with `kubectl` and ArgoCD puts it back to match Git.

In practice: who deployed what lives in Git history in `clearledger-infra`. What should be running is whatever those manifests say. To roll back, revert a commit in the infra repo. If someone edits the cluster by hand, ArgoCD undoes it — you will prove that below.

### Pre-sync checklist — run before `argocd app sync`

ArgoCD applies whatever is in `clearledger-infra`. Wrong content causes red pods that look like a broken install. **You verify Git manually:**

**On GitHub** (`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra/tree/main/manifests`):

| Check | Pass criteria |
|---|---|
| `auth-service/deployment.yaml` | Contains `secretKeyRef` — **no** `vault.hashicorp.com` lines |
| `auth-service/secret.yaml` | File exists |
| `ledger-service/secret.yaml` | File exists |
| `kustomization.yaml` → `resources:` | Lists both `*-service/secret.yaml` |
| `kustomization.yaml` → `newName:` | Your Docker Hub user — replace `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` before Stage 1.3 |
| `netpol/` folder | **Absent** |
| `vault/` folder | **Absent** until Stage 5 |

**On your laptop:**

```bash
# Application manifest must point at YOUR infra repo (after sed in next section)
grep repoURL stages/stage-2-gitops/argocd/clearledger-app.yaml

# Stage 0 workloads still healthy before ArgoCD takes over
kubectl get pods -n clearledger
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://clearledger.local/auth/health
```

Expected: `repoURL` contains your GitHub username; all app pods `Running`; curl `200`.

Only when every row passes → install ArgoCD and sync below.

---

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd 2>/dev/null || true
kubectl apply -n argocd --server-side --force-conflicts -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -n argocd --timeout=180s
```

**Why `--server-side --force-conflicts`?** Argo CD ships a very large `applicationsets.argoproj.io` CRD. A normal `kubectl apply` tries to stash the whole thing in an annotation, hits a 256 KiB limit, and errors with `metadata.annotations: Too long`. Server-side apply avoids that. It is [how Argo CD expects you to install](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/) — not a lab workaround.

Get the admin password:

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d && echo
```

**Configure Argo CD for your NGINX ingress.** The browser talks HTTPS to ingress; ingress talks plain HTTP to the Argo CD server. Without this, the UI often breaks with `503` or `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` on live-update URLs (`/api/v1/stream/*`).

```bash
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-2-gitops/infra/argocd-cmd-params.yaml
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-2-gitops/infra/argocd-ingress.yaml
kubectl rollout restart deployment/argocd-server -n argocd
kubectl rollout status deployment/argocd-server -n argocd --timeout=180s
```

**Expected in `argocd-cmd-params-cm`:** `server.insecure: "true"`, `server.grpc.web: "true"`, `server.url: https://argocd.local`

Open **`https://argocd.local`**. Login: `admin` and the password from above. Accept the self-signed certificate warning if the browser shows one.

**Expected:** The Applications page loads. In the browser console (F12 → Console), you should not see `401` or `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`. If the UI looks fine in a normal window, you are done — incognito is not required.

**If login fails with `401 Unauthorized`** (often after a config change or a bad earlier login), try a private/incognito window or clear site data for `argocd.local`, then log in again. Still stuck? See [troubleshooting.md — ArgoCD](troubleshooting.md#argocd-ui-401-or-err_http2_protocol_error).

Connect ArgoCD to the infra repo and apply the Application manifest:

**1. Edit `stages/stage-2-gitops/argocd/clearledger-app.yaml`** — set `spec.source.repoURL` to your infra repo (your GitHub username, not `git config user.name`).

**2. Register the repo with Argo CD:**

```bash
# macOS: brew install argocd
argocd login argocd.local --username admin --password YOUR_PASSWORD --insecure --grpc-web

# Public repo
argocd repo add https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git --grpc-web

# Private repo — PAT from Stage 1 §1.4 (you saved it as GitHub secret INFRA_REPO_TOKEN)
export INFRA_REPO_TOKEN='ghp_...'   # paste here; GitHub only shows it once at creation
argocd repo add https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git \
  --username git --password "$INFRA_REPO_TOKEN" --grpc-web
```

**Verify Argo CD can reach the repo** (do this before applying the Application):

```bash
argocd repo list --grpc-web
```

Look for your `clearledger-infra` URL with **TYPE** `git` and connection **Successful**. If it shows **Failed** or the repo is missing, Argo CD cannot sync — fix credentials before §4 or any stage that depends on GitOps. After a VM restore or Argo CD reinstall, you may need to run `argocd repo add` again (credentials are stored in the cluster, not in Git).

**3. Apply and sync:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-2-gitops/argocd/clearledger-app.yaml
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web
```

### How to read the Argo CD UI (you are not just "looking at a UI")

After sync, open the **clearledger** application in the tree view. Three badges at the top tell you almost everything:

**APP HEALTH: Healthy** — Kubernetes thinks the workloads are running. Pods are up (or still starting if it says Progressing).

**SYNC STATUS: Synced** — The cluster matches `clearledger-infra` on GitHub at the commit shown (e.g. `main (2c88aa1)`). Git is the source of truth and Argo CD applied it.

**LAST SYNC: Succeeded** — The most recent apply from Git worked. If this failed, click it for the error.

The **resource tree** below is the same app broken into pieces: namespace, secrets, services, deployments, ingress, etc. Green checkmarks = applied from Git. Click any box (e.g. `deploy/auth-service`) → **Live Manifest** vs **Desired** to see what Argo CD thinks should run.

**Quick "is the app actually working?" test** (outside Argo CD):

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/auth/health
```

`200` = the app is reachable end-to-end, not only "green in Argo CD."

**When something is wrong:** HEALTH goes **Degraded** or **Progressing** for a long time; SYNC goes **OutOfSync**; a resource in the tree turns **red**. Click that resource → **Events** or **Logs**. The kubectl checks below double-check the same thing from the terminal.

Confirm ArgoCD is watching **all** workloads (not only ingress):

```bash
argocd app resources clearledger --grpc-web | grep Deployment
```

**Pass looks like your output:**

```text
apps    Deployment    clearledger    auth-service            No
apps    Deployment    clearledger    frontend                No
apps    Deployment    clearledger    ledger-service          No
apps    Deployment    clearledger    notification-service  No
apps    Deployment    clearledger    redis                   No
```

**How to read it:** each line is one Deployment Argo CD manages from `clearledger-infra/manifests/`. Seeing all five app deployments (plus `redis`) means it rendered the full `kustomization.yaml` — not just `ingress.yaml`.

The last column is **ORPHANED**. **`No` is good** — the resource belongs to this app. You would only worry if deployments were **missing** from this list, or if the UI showed **OutOfSync** / red health.

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — first sync healthy**

Run these four checks. **Pass looks like:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger
# Every app pod 1/1 Running (postgres/redis may show older RESTARTS from VM reboots — OK)

kubectl get application clearledger -n argocd \
  -o jsonpath='sync={.status.sync.status} health={.status.health.status}{"\n"}'
# sync=Synced health=Healthy

curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/auth/health
# 200

kubectl logs -n clearledger deploy/auth-service --tail=5 2>/dev/null | head -3
# Lines like: GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
# Bad sign: DATABASE_URL is not set
```

**If all four pass → Stage 2 first sync is done.** Continue to **Enable CI → ArgoCD handoff** below, then `make check-2` and `make snapshot STAGE=2`.

### Enable CI → ArgoCD handoff (close the Stage 1 deployment gap)

GitHub → your `clearledger` repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** → **New repository variable**:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC` | `true` |

The next green pipeline run nudges ArgoCD after updating `clearledger-infra` (uses `microk8s kubectl` on the runner). That nudge is optional and non-fatal — if it cannot reach the cluster, the manifest push still succeeded and ArgoCD syncs on its next poll (~3 min).

Leave this **unset during Stage 1** — that is how you proved the cluster did not change until GitOps existed.

Leave **`ENABLE_DAST` unset** for now. Stage 3 walks you through turning on OWASP ZAP once the app is reliably live at `clearledger.local`.

If health is **Progressing** or pods are red → read the section below **before** taking screenshots or continuing to Stage 3.

### If the UI shows red pods or "Progressing" (read this before the screenshot)

This is a common first-sync surprise, not a broken install.

**Three statuses, three meanings:**

| What you see | Plain English |
|---|---|
| **Synced** | Git and the cluster agree on *what should exist* |
| **Progressing** | ArgoCD is still waiting for pods to become ready |
| **Red pod / 0/1** | A new pod is crashing or failing its health check |

You can be **Synced** and **Progressing** at the same time: manifests applied, but not every pod is healthy yet.

**Why it happens in Stage 2**

ArgoCD syncs whatever is in `clearledger-infra`. Deployments must use **`secretKeyRef`** (Stages 2–4) — not Vault injection. If your infra repo has Vault annotations from an older lab copy, auth/ledger crash with `DATABASE_URL is not set` until Stage 5.

Network policies belong to **Stage 6** (runtime security). They live in `infra/deferred-by-stage/stage-6-runtime-security/netpol/` in this repo — **not** in `infra/manifests/`.

If `manifests/netpol/` is still in your **`clearledger-infra`** repo on GitHub (from an older copy of the lab), ArgoCD will keep applying it. Those policies use **default-deny** and break DNS for new pods, so you see red **0/1** pods and **Progressing** health.

**Fix for Stage 2**

Do **both** steps. Deleting only in the cluster is not enough — ArgoCD recreates policies from Git on the next sync.

**Step 1 — remove from `clearledger-infra` on GitHub**

Delete the folder `manifests/netpol/` → commit: `chore: defer network policies to Stage 6`.

**Step 2 — sync and restart**

```bash
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web
kubectl delete networkpolicy -n clearledger --all   # safe once Git no longer has netpol
kubectl rollout restart deployment/auth-service deployment/ledger-service -n clearledger
argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep -E "Sync Status|Health Status"
```

Network policies stay in **`clearledger`** under `infra/deferred-by-stage/` until you apply them in Stage 6.

When that looks good, continue below.

---

When sync finishes and health is **Healthy**, you should see the **clearledger** app in the UI with green **Healthy** and **Synced** badges — repo pointing at your `clearledger-infra` repo on `main`, path `manifests`, namespace `clearledger`. Open the app tile and the resource tree should show deployments, services, and ingresses reconciled with no red pods.

From the CLI, `argocd app get clearledger` should echo the same story: `Sync Status: Synced`, `Health Status: Healthy`, and each resource listed as synced.

### ArgoCD stuck OutOfSync (break-glass fix)

**Normal path:** CI copies full manifests + updates Kustomize tags → ArgoCD auto-syncs within ~3 minutes.

**If still OutOfSync after 10+ minutes:**

```bash
make fix-argocd
```

This re-syncs canonical manifests to `clearledger-infra` (Kustomize SHAs preserved), re-applies the Application, and triggers a hard refresh. **Do not** `kubectl apply` deployments — fix Git, let ArgoCD sync.

```bash
kubectl annotate application clearledger -n argocd argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web --prune
kubectl get application clearledger -n argocd -o jsonpath='sync={.status.sync.status} health={.status.health.status}{"\n"}'
```

**Take a screenshot of that view** — the app tile or the resource tree is fine. That’s your portfolio proof that GitOps is actually running.

**Prove the contract — this is the aha moment:**

The point is **not** to change Git. `kubectl set image` only changes what is running in the cluster. ArgoCD compares the cluster to `clearledger-infra`; if they differ, it shows **OutOfSync** and `selfHeal` puts the cluster back to match Git.

Before you run the demo, confirm the app is **Healthy** (not **Progressing**) and that Deployments are managed — see the red-pods section above if not.

```bash
argocd app resources clearledger --grpc-web | grep Deployment
```

```bash
# Manually change the image in the cluster only (Git stays the same)
kubectl set image deployment/auth-service \
  auth-service=$DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:fake-tag \
  -n clearledger

# ArgoCD should flip to OutOfSync within a minute or two
argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep -E "Sync Status|Health Status"

# Wait for selfHeal (default sync interval is ~3 minutes)
sleep 180

# Cluster image should match clearledger-infra again — Git was never edited
kubectl get deployment auth-service -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

The image is back to the Git version. The cluster self-corrected without anyone editing the infra repo. That is GitOps: Git is the contract, ArgoCD enforces it on the cluster.

```bash
make check-2
```

---

### Rolling back a bad deploy

> You just proved that ArgoCD reverts unauthorized cluster changes. Now flip it: **what if you pushed a bad commit yourself?** GitOps rollback is not a button — it is a git operation. This section explains why, shows you both methods, and has you practise each one before you need them under pressure.

#### How you know you need to roll back

These symptoms appearing within minutes of a push to `clearledger-infra` point at a bad commit:

- Pods stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error` — check with `kubectl get pods -n clearledger`
- `kubectl logs <pod> -n clearledger --previous` shows startup errors that were not there before
- ArgoCD health flips from `Healthy` to `Degraded` or stays on `Progressing` — check with `argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web`
- The app returns 5xx errors or login stops working — check with `curl -I http://clearledger.local/health`

If you see any of these within minutes of a push, assume the latest commit is the cause and roll back first — investigate second.

---

#### Why ArgoCD rollback is not just a button

ArgoCD has a rollback button in the UI and an `argocd app rollback` command. Both work — but only if you understand the interaction with `selfHeal`.

Your Application (`stages/stage-2-gitops/argocd/clearledger-app.yaml`) is configured with:

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    selfHeal: true
```

**What `selfHeal: true` means in plain English**

Git (`clearledger-infra`) is the boss. The cluster must match Git. If someone changes the cluster without changing Git — manual `kubectl`, or the Argo CD **Rollback** button — Argo CD notices the mismatch and **puts the cluster back to whatever Git says**, usually within a few minutes.

So the UI rollback only changes the **cluster**. It does **not** change Git. With self-heal on, Argo CD sees “cluster ≠ Git” and re-applies Git — your rollback gets undone. You thought you rolled back; Git still says the bad version, so the bad version comes back.

**The GitOps rollback:** change Git (`git revert` in `clearledger-infra`). Then self-heal helps you — cluster and Git both point at the good version.

**Emergency UI rollback:** turn off auto-sync first, then rollback, then fix Git. Details below.

There are two correct ways to roll back, and the right one depends on how much time you have.

---

#### Method 1 — Git revert (preferred, always try this first)

This is the GitOps way. You do not touch the cluster. You change Git, and ArgoCD syncs the fix.

**When to use:** You have a few minutes. You can identify the bad commit in `clearledger-infra`.

**How it works:**

```
Bad commit pushed to clearledger-infra
        ↓
ArgoCD auto-synced it (cluster is now broken)
        ↓
You run: git revert <bad-commit> && git push
        ↓
ArgoCD auto-syncs the revert (cluster is fixed, selfHeal works with you)
        ↓
Git history shows the bad deploy AND the revert — full audit trail
```

**Step-by-step:**

```bash
# 1. Go to your clearledger-infra repo (wherever you cloned it)
cd ~/clearledger-infra      # adjust path if you cloned elsewhere
git pull                    # make sure you are up to date

# 2. Find the bad commit
git log --oneline -10

# Output looks like:
# abc1234 update ledger-service image to v1.4.0   ← this broke prod
# def5678 update auth-service image to v1.3.1     ← was fine
# 9a1b2c3 add vault rotation cronjob

# 3. Revert it — this creates a NEW commit, it does not delete history
git revert abc1234 --no-edit

# 4. Push — ArgoCD picks it up automatically within ~3 minutes
git push

# 5. Confirm the cluster recovered
kubectl get pods -n clearledger
argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep -E "Sync Status|Health Status"
# Expected: Sync Status: Synced, Health Status: Healthy
```

**Why this is preferred:**
- `selfHeal` works *with* you — the new `HEAD` is already the reverted state, nothing fights you
- Full audit trail — Git shows the bad deploy, the revert, and who did both
- No cluster commands needed — ArgoCD applies everything
- Compliant — regulators and on-call engineers can read exactly what happened from Git history alone

---

#### Method 2 — Emergency ArgoCD rollback (when the cluster is on fire)

Use this when the cluster is broken right now and you do not have time to push a Git fix. It pins the cluster to a previous known-good deployment immediately. You will still fix Git afterward — this is a stabilise-first step, not a permanent fix.

**When to use:** Incident in progress. Pods are crashing, users are affected, and you need the cluster back to a known-good state in under 30 seconds.

> **Before you start:** confirm your ArgoCD CLI session is still valid. If it expired, re-login first — an expired session will silently fail every command below.
> ```bash
> argocd account get-user-info --grpc-web
> # If you see "Unauthenticated", re-login:
> ARGOCD_PASSWORD=$(kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret \
>   -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d)
> argocd login argocd.local --username admin --password "$ARGOCD_PASSWORD" \
>   --insecure --grpc-web
> ```

**Step 1 — Disable auto-sync** (critical — skip this and selfHeal will undo your rollback within 3 minutes)

```bash
argocd app set clearledger --sync-policy none --grpc-web
# Confirm: automated sync is now off
argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep "Sync Policy"
# Expected: Sync Policy: <none>
```

**Step 2 — Find the last known-good deployment ID**

```bash
argocd app history clearledger --grpc-web

# Output looks like:
# ID   DATE                           REVISION
# 9    2026-06-05 10:12:00 +0000 UTC  abc1234  ← bad deploy (current)
# 8    2026-06-04 14:46:06 +0000 UTC  def5678  ← known good
# 7    2026-06-01 20:53:19 +0000 UTC  9a1b2c3

# Or check via kubectl (no argocd CLI needed):
kubectl get application clearledger -n argocd \
  -o jsonpath='{range .status.history[*]}{.id}{"\t"}{.deployedAt}{"\t"}{.revision}{"\n"}{end}'
```

Use the ID (the number on the left), not the SHA.

**Step 3 — Roll back to the known-good ID**

```bash
argocd app rollback clearledger 8 --grpc-web
```

**Step 4 — Confirm the cluster is stable**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger
# All pods should be Running

argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep -E "Sync Status|Health Status"
# Sync Status:   OutOfSync  ← expected — cluster is at rev 8, Git is still at the bad HEAD
# Health Status: Healthy    ← this is what matters right now
```

`OutOfSync` is correct and expected at this point. The cluster is running the old known-good revision. Git still has the bad commit — you will fix that next.

**Step 5 — Fix Git (do not leave it broken)**

```bash
cd ~/clearledger-infra
git pull
git revert <bad-commit-sha> --no-edit
git push
```

**Step 6 — Re-enable auto-sync**

```bash
argocd app set clearledger \
  --sync-policy automated \
  --self-heal \
  --auto-prune \
  --grpc-web

# Trigger an immediate sync so you do not wait for the next auto-check
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web

# Confirm everything is clean
argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep -E "Sync Status|Health Status"
# Expected: Sync Status: Synced, Health Status: Healthy
```

> **Never leave auto-sync disabled longer than the incident.** It is your drift-detection and tamper-evidence mechanism — without it, unauthorized `kubectl` changes go undetected. Re-enable it the moment you push the Git fix.

---

#### Practise the rollback now (before you need it under pressure)

Do not wait for a real incident to run this for the first time. The steps below simulate a bad image tag deploy and walk you through Method 1 (the preferred path).

**Step 1 — Push a bad image tag to `clearledger-infra`**

```bash
cd ~/clearledger-infra
git pull

# Edit manifests/notification-service/deployment.yaml
# Change the image tag to a tag that does not exist, e.g.:
#   image: docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-notification-service:broken-tag

# Commit and push it
git add manifests/notification-service/deployment.yaml
git commit -m "test: simulate bad deploy with nonexistent image tag"
git push
```

**Step 2 — Watch ArgoCD sync the bad state**

```bash
# Give ArgoCD ~3 minutes to pick it up, or trigger immediately:
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web

# Watch the notification-service pod fail
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -w
# You will see: notification-service pod stuck in ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull
```

**Step 3 — Roll back using Method 1**

```bash
cd ~/clearledger-infra

# Revert the bad commit
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push

# ArgoCD will auto-sync — or trigger it:
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web

# Watch pods recover
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -w
# notification-service should return to Running
```

**Step 4 — Verify**

```bash
argocd app get clearledger --grpc-web | grep -E "Sync Status|Health Status"
# Expected: Sync Status: Synced, Health Status: Healthy

kubectl get pods -n clearledger
# All pods Running, no ImagePullBackOff
```

You have now practised a rollback end-to-end. The `git revert` commit is permanently in the infra repo's history — a real audit record of a simulated recovery.

---

#### Quick reference

**Use Method 1 (git revert) when:**
- A bad image tag or manifest was pushed to `clearledger-infra` and you have a few minutes
- Any config change in the infra repo caused pods to break
- This is almost always the right answer — it is fast, safe, and leaves a clean audit trail

**Use Method 2 (emergency ArgoCD rollback) when:**
- The cluster is broken right now, users are affected, and you need it stable in under 30 seconds
- You are not yet sure which commit caused the problem and need time to investigate — roll back to stabilise, then use `git log` to find the culprit, then fix forward with Method 1

**Neither method applies when:**
- A pod is crashing but nothing was pushed to the infra repo recently — this is not a rollback problem. Check `kubectl logs`, Vault connectivity, and network policies instead.

`revisionHistoryLimit: 10` in `stages/stage-2-gitops/argocd/clearledger-app.yaml` means ArgoCD always has 10 previous deployments available for emergency rollback. Increase it if your release cadence is high.

---

### What you learned in Stage 2

- What GitOps means: Git is the single source of truth, and a tool enforces it
- What ArgoCD does: watches Git, compares it to the cluster, corrects drift automatically
- How the full flow works now: push code → CI builds image → CI updates infra repo → ArgoCD syncs cluster
- **No one runs `kubectl` to deploy anymore.** The pipeline updates Git, ArgoCD does the rest.
- **How to roll back safely:** `git revert` in the infra repo is the correct answer; ArgoCD emergency rollback is the break-glass option, and you must disable auto-sync first or selfHeal will silently undo it

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Implemented GitOps with ArgoCD so cluster state is driven from Git, with drift detection, auto-sync, and a Git-based rollback of a bad deploy.

### DevSecOps lesson — Stage 2 in one paragraph

**Git is the contract; the controller enforces it.** Stage 1 wrote *what should run* into `clearledger-infra`. Stage 2 installs a reconciler — ArgoCD — that continuously compares the cluster to that repo and fixes drift. Manual `kubectl set image` does not change Git; it only changes the live cluster, and `selfHeal` puts the cluster back. That is the DevSecOps/GitOps payoff: deployments are **auditable** (Git history), **repeatable** (revert a commit to roll back), and **tamper-evident** (unauthorized cluster edits get reverted). The full chain is now push → CI updates infra Git → ArgoCD syncs cluster — still no human deploy step. Stage 3 adds security gates on the CI side; Stage 4 adds a cluster gate for anything that tries to skip them.

**Save your VM before Stage 3.** After `make check-2` passes and repository variable `ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC` is `true`:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=2
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage2 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=2`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 3 — Security Gates

Every push runs security checks. Some failures stop the pipeline right away. Others you learn from now and enforce in the cluster later (Stage 4).

**Goal:** understand six scanners — what each one looks at, what it catches, and how to read a failure. You will break each gate on purpose (§3.4) so a red CI job is not a surprise.

**Ready for Stage 3?**

- `make check-2` passes
- `ENABLE_ARGOCD_SYNC=true` on GitHub (you set this in Stage 2)
- `ENABLE_DAST` still **unset** (turn on later in this stage if you want)
- Argo CD at `http://argocd.local` shows **Synced**
- Optional: skim [Stage 1 security posture](#stage-1-security-posture--what-blocks-vs-what-waits) — Stage 1 already ran many of these tools

**Done when:** `make check-3` passes and you triggered each gate once (§3.4). Then `make snapshot STAGE=3` and `make snapshots`.

---

### What you need to know first

One tool is not enough. Each scanner guards a different layer:

- **Gitleaks** — secrets in code or Git history (API keys, tokens)
- **Semgrep (SAST)** — bugs in your Python/JS source (injection, unsafe patterns)
- **Trivy (SCA + images)** — known CVEs in pip/npm packages and in built Docker images
- **Checkov (IaC)** — misconfigs in Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests
- **Cosign** — proves images were built and signed by your pipeline

**What blocks CI today:** secrets, bad code (SAST), vulnerable images, Dockerfile issues on production images.

**What waits for later:** some Kubernetes manifest findings are reported in Stage 1 as evidence; Stage 4 (Kyverno) turns the important ones into cluster enforcement.

**Where checks run:** When you `git commit`, hooks on your laptop can scan first (pre-commit). When you `git push`, GitHub Actions scans again on the runner. Same idea twice — catch mistakes before they waste a 10-minute pipeline. Pre-commit is optional to install; CI always runs on push either way.

---

### Enable DAST (optional — after Stage 2)

DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) scans the **running** app at `http://clearledger.local`. It was off in Stages 1–2 on purpose: Stage 1 never deployed to the cluster, and Stage 2 was about getting GitOps healthy first.

If `make check-2` passes and `curl http://clearledger.local/auth/health` returns `200`, you can turn DAST on:

GitHub → your `clearledger` repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** → **New repository variable**:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `ENABLE_DAST` | `true` |

Push a small commit (or re-run the last workflow on `main`). The **DAST (OWASP ZAP + fintech API tests)** job should run instead of **skipped**. A failed ZAP scan is a real finding to investigate; **skipped** before this step only means the toggle was off.

---

### 3.1 — Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew — avoids PEP 668 "externally-managed-environment" from pip3):
brew install pre-commit

# Linux/WSL2:
# sudo apt install -y pre-commit
# or: python3 -m pip install --user pre-commit

pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If some hooks fail on first run, see [§3.1 — Install pre-commit hooks](#31--install-pre-commit-hooks). **Gitleaks and Ruff must pass** — YAML/Terraform issues on later-stage files are OK until you reach those stages.

Test it catches secrets locally before CI does:

```bash
echo 'AWS_SECRET = "'$(printf '%s%s' 'AKIA' 'IOSFODNN7EXAMPLE')'"' >> app/auth-service/main.py
git add app/auth-service/main.py && git commit -m "test"
# Gitleaks fires and blocks the commit — see "What you should see" below
git restore --staged app/auth-service/main.py
git checkout app/auth-service/main.py
```

The commit was blocked before it even reached Git. If the pre-commit hook was not installed, that fake AWS key would be in your Git history permanently (even if you delete the line later, Git remembers).

> **Already did Cosign in Stage 1?** That counts. Stage 3 does not require regenerating keys — confirm `infra/cosign.pub` exists and GitHub has `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` + `COSIGN_PASSWORD`. Stage 4 turns signing into **enforcement** at the cluster gate.

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — pre-commit actually blocks a secret**

Installed-but-not-wired is the classic silent failure. Prove the hooks fire:

```bash
echo 'AWS_SECRET='"$(printf '%s%s' 'AKIA' 'IOSFODNN7EXAMPLE')" > leak-test.env
git add leak-test.env
pre-commit run --all-files; echo "exit=$?"
git reset leak-test.env >/dev/null; rm -f leak-test.env
```

Expected: the secret-scanning hook **fails** the run (`exit=1`) and flags `leak-test.env`. If `exit=0`, your hooks are installed but not catching anything — re-run `pre-commit install` and confirm `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists.

If you skip this, commits sail through unscanned and you will believe Stage 3 is protecting you when it is not.

### 3.2 — Generate Cosign keys

**Cosign** signs your Docker images with a cryptographic key. When you deploy to the cluster, Kyverno (Stage 4) can verify the signature and reject any image that was not signed by your pipeline. This prevents someone from pushing a malicious image to your Docker Hub and having the cluster run it.

```bash
# macOS: brew install cosign
# Linux/WSL2: curl -O -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/v2.2.4/cosign-linux-amd64 && chmod +x cosign-linux-amd64 && sudo mv cosign-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cosign

cosign generate-key-pair   # enter a password when prompted
```

This creates two files: `cosign.key` (private, used by the pipeline to sign) and `cosign.pub` (public, used by Kyverno to verify).

Insert your public key into the Kyverno policy (replace the placeholder block in `infra/policies/require-signed-images.yaml` with the contents of `cosign.pub`).

Add secrets to GitHub (github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of `cosign.key` |
| `COSIGN_PASSWORD` | The password you entered when generating keys |

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — Cosign keypair exists and is gitignored**

Stage 4's image-signing policy depends on this exact state:

```bash
test -f cosign.key && echo "private key present"
test -f cosign.pub && echo "public key present"
grep -q "BEGIN PUBLIC KEY" cosign.pub && echo "public key valid"
git check-ignore cosign.key && echo "private key correctly ignored"
```

Expected: all four success lines print. If `git check-ignore` prints nothing, your private key is **not** ignored — add it to `.gitignore` before any commit.

If you skip this, §4.2 fails confusingly later — pods admitted then ImagePullBackOff, or a silent pass.

### 3.3 — Activate the full security pipeline

The security gates are already in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. Push any change to trigger the full pipeline:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "ci: full DevSecOps pipeline" && git push origin main
```

### 3.4 — Break each gate on purpose

For each gate: break something on purpose, read how the tool reports it, revert, confirm green again. Try the local command first, then push once if you want a screenshot on GitHub Actions.

```bash
# 1. Break it   2. Run locally or push   3. Read the failure
# 4. git checkout -- path/to/file   5. pre-commit run --all-files (optional)   6. git push
```

Start with **Gate 1** end-to-end before the others.

---

#### Gate 1 — Gitleaks (secrets)

**Inject:** hardcoded AWS key in any Python file.

```bash
echo 'AWS_KEY = "'$(printf '%s%s' 'AKIA' 'IOSFODNN7EXAMPLE')'"' >> app/auth-service/main.py
git add app/auth-service/main.py && git commit -m "test: trigger gitleaks"
# pre-commit blocks this commit locally — that is the test.
# For a CI screenshot only: git commit --no-verify -m "test: trigger gitleaks" && git push
```

**Done looks like (terminal — pre-commit):**

```text
🔑 Secrets scan (Gitleaks)...............................................Failed
- hook id: gitleaks
- exit code: 1

Finding:     AWS_KEY = "REDACTED"
RuleID:      aws-access-token
File:        app/auth-service/main.py
Line:        316
```

**Done looks like (CI — job `Secrets Scan (Gitleaks)`):** red ✗ on workflow; log contains `leaks found: 1` and the file path. **Build jobs do not start** — pipeline stops here.

**Revert:**

```bash
git restore --staged app/auth-service/main.py 2>/dev/null
git checkout app/auth-service/main.py
pre-commit run gitleaks --all-files   # → Passed
```

---

#### Gate 2 — Semgrep (SAST)

**Local dry-run** (no repo change):

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/sec-gates-venv && /tmp/sec-gates-venv/bin/pip install semgrep
cat > /tmp/semgrep-bad.py << 'EOF'
import subprocess
from fastapi import Request
def bad(request: Request):
    subprocess.run(request.query_params.get("cmd"), shell=True)
EOF
/tmp/sec-gates-venv/bin/semgrep \
  --config=p/python --config=p/security-audit --config=p/owasp-top-ten --error \
  /tmp/semgrep-bad.py
```

**Break CI** — add a throwaway file Semgrep will scan, commit, push:

```bash
cat > app/auth-service/gate_test_semgrep.py << 'EOF'
import subprocess
from fastapi import Request
def bad(request: Request):
    subprocess.run(request.query_params.get("cmd"), shell=True)
EOF
git add app/auth-service/gate_test_semgrep.py && git commit -m "test: trigger semgrep" && git push
```

**Pass:** `subprocess-shell-true` / `Blocking` in the log. CI job **`SAST (Semgrep)`** red ✗; **`Build images`** and below do not run.

**Revert:**

```bash
rm -f app/auth-service/gate_test_semgrep.py
git add -A && git commit -m "revert: semgrep gate test" && git push
```

---

#### Gate 3 — Checkov (IaC / Dockerfile)

**Learn locally** — missing `HEALTHCHECK` shows up in Checkov output but may not fail CI (only HIGH/CRITICAL hard-fail):

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/sec-gates-venv && /tmp/sec-gates-venv/bin/pip install checkov
sed '/^HEALTHCHECK/,+1d' app/auth-service/Dockerfile > /tmp/Dockerfile-nohc
mkdir -p /tmp/checkov-demo/app/auth-service
cp /tmp/Dockerfile-nohc /tmp/checkov-demo/app/auth-service/Dockerfile
/tmp/sec-gates-venv/bin/checkov --directory /tmp/checkov-demo --framework dockerfile
```

**Break CI** — add `EXPOSE 22` (shows **CKV_DOCKER_1** in the log). CI only goes red if Checkov rates it HIGH/CRITICAL (`--hard-fail-on` in `ci.yaml`); if the job stays green, you still passed the exercise by reading the finding in the log and artifact **`checkov-results`**.

```bash
echo 'EXPOSE 22' >> app/auth-service/Dockerfile
git add app/auth-service/Dockerfile && git commit -m "test: trigger checkov" && git push
```

**Pass:** log or artifact shows **CKV_DOCKER_1** (SSH port exposed). Job **`IaC Scan (Checkov)`** red ✗ is a bonus, not required for §3.4 — use **Gitleaks, Semgrep, or Trivy** for a screenshot of a failed job.

**Revert:**

```bash
git checkout app/auth-service/Dockerfile
git commit -am "revert: checkov gate test" && git push
```

---

#### Gate 4 — Trivy (image CVEs)

**Local dry-run** — scan an old base image (no build):

```bash
trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL,HIGH --ignore-unfixed python:3.8-slim
```

**Break CI** — pin an old base in the Dockerfile, push, wait for **`Scan images`**:

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/FROM python:3.13-slim/FROM python:3.8-slim/' app/auth-service/Dockerfile
git add app/auth-service/Dockerfile && git commit -m "test: trigger trivy" && git push
```

**Pass:** **`Scan images`** → **Trivy scan all images** exits 1 with a CVE table (`HIGH` / `CRITICAL`). **`Publish images`** and **`Update Manifests`** are skipped.

**Revert:**

```bash
git checkout app/auth-service/Dockerfile
git commit -am "revert: trivy gate test" && git push
```

---

### 3.5 — When a scan fails on a CVE you didn't inject

§3.4 is deliberate. This section is for the other case: you changed nothing, pushed, and **Scan images** went red anyway. New CVEs land in the database every week. That is normal — fix the package, do not weaken the gate.

**Find the real error.** Scroll up in **Trivy scan all images** for the CVE table (Package, CVE, Installed, **Fixed Version**). Or download **Artifacts → image-scan-results → trivy-auth-results.json**.

**Ignore this red herring** at the bottom of the log:

```text
Version 0.71.2 of Trivy is now available
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

The version notice does not fail the job. A fixable HIGH/CRITICAL CVE does. Do not add `--skip-version-check` to “fix” it.

**Fix it:**

- **pip package** — bump to the Fixed Version in `requirements.txt` (example: `python-multipart==0.0.30` for CVE-2026-53539). Apply the same bump to sibling services if they share that pin.
- **OS package** — newer base image or a targeted `apt`/`apk` upgrade in the Dockerfile.
- **No stable fix yet** — documented exception only: add the CVE to `.trivyignore` and `.grype.yaml` with a comment (see `CVE-2026-7210`).

Do not remove `--exit-code 1`, drop HIGH from `--severity`, or disable scanning. More help: [troubleshooting.md — Trivy](troubleshooting.md#trivy-blocks-python-service-images).

---

### Finish Stage 3

**Gate cheat sheet** (for §3.4 screenshots): Gitleaks → `Secrets Scan`; Semgrep → `SAST`; Trivy → `Scan images` (CVE table). Checkov → read `CKV_*` in the log (job may stay green).

After each §3.4 test: revert, push, confirm the workflow is green again. One red-job screenshot is enough for a portfolio.

**Done when:**

```bash
make check-3   # must end: All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.
```

You also triggered at least one gate in §3.4 (Gitleaks locally counts). Optional: `ENABLE_DAST=true` if you want ZAP later — not required to leave Stage 3.

**Not required yet:** Kubernetes Checkov blocking CI, Cosign blocking deploys — those tighten in **Stage 4** (Kyverno).

**Next:** Stage 4 stops bad pods at the cluster door even if someone uses `kubectl` and skips CI.

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=3 && make snapshots
```

---

## Stage 4 — Admission Control (Kyverno)

> Even if CI passes, the cluster can still refuse.

CI scans your code and images before they reach GitOps, but it cannot watch everything that happens inside the cluster. Someone with `kubectl` access could apply a manifest directly. A Helm chart you install might create pods that violate your security standards. Those paths never hit the pipeline — which is why Stage 4 adds **admission control**: a checkpoint built into Kubernetes itself. Every time something tries to create or update a resource, the request passes through admission webhooks before it takes effect. If a webhook rejects the request, the resource is never created.

**Kyverno** is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that uses those webhooks. You write policies as YAML files (not application code), and Kyverno enforces them on every matching resource in the cluster — for example, rejecting any pod that runs as root or requiring CPU and memory limits on every container. The difference from CI is timing: CI scans *before* code ships; Kyverno enforces at the *cluster gate*. Together they give you two layers of defense.

**Your goal in this stage** is to install Kyverno, apply the policies in `infra/policies/`, and prove in §4.4 that non-compliant pods are denied before the container runtime ever sees them.

**Before you start**, make sure the foundation from earlier stages is still solid: `make check-3` should pass (pre-commit hooks and CI security gates are active), `infra/cosign.pub` should exist from Stage 3, and ArgoCD should still be syncing so the app responds at `http://clearledger.local`. If any of those are red, fix them first — Kyverno sits on top of a healthy cluster, not a broken one.

**You are done with Stage 4** when all three break-it scenarios in §4.4 are denied, `make check-4` passes, and you have saved your progress with `make snapshot STAGE=4` followed by `make snapshots` (confirm `clearledger.stage4` appears in the list).

**What changes from Stage 3 is enforcement, not scanning.** In CI, Checkov reported Kubernetes misconfigurations but did not block the pipeline; Kyverno now stops those same classes of problems at the cluster gate. Cosign has been signing your images since Stage 1; Kyverno now *requires* that signature before a ClearLedger image can deploy. This is where [Stage 1 evidence becomes enforcement](#stage-1-security-posture--what-blocks-vs-what-waits) — see that section if you want the full map of what blocked in Stage 1 versus what waited for Stage 4.

Start at **§4.1** to install Kyverno. If install, policies, break-it scenarios, or `make check-4` fail, read [troubleshooting.md — Stage 4](troubleshooting.md#stage-4-admission-control-troubleshooting) before changing Helm charts or policy YAML.

### What Kyverno enforces

All policy files live in `infra/policies/`. Kyverno itself is installed via Helm using `stages/stage-4-admission-control/infra/kyverno/values.yaml`.

| Policy | What it enforces | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `disallow-root-containers` | `runAsNonRoot: true` | CIS K8s 5.2.6 |
| `require-resource-limits` | CPU/memory requests and limits | CIS K8s 5.2.4 |
| `disallow-privilege-escalation` | `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` | CIS K8s 5.2.5 |
| `drop-all-capabilities` | `capabilities.drop: [ALL]` | CIS K8s 5.2.7 |
| `require-signed-images` | Cosign signature on ClearLedger images | SLSA Level 2 |

### Platform stability — from Stage 4 onward

From Stage 4 on you are running more controllers on a single-node VM — Kyverno, storage provisioners, and later Prometheus and Loki. A pod can show `Running` while it is actually crash-looping in the background. When **platform** pods (Kyverno controllers, `hostpath-provisioner`, the Prometheus operator, and similar) accumulate high `RESTARTS`, the API server starts timing out, `kubectl` feels flaky, and you can waste days debugging the wrong component because the app pods look fine.

**After every stage from here on**, give the cluster about ten minutes to settle, then run the stage health check:

```bash
bash scripts/health-check.sh <stage>    # e.g. 4, 7, 7.5
# or the Makefile shortcut:
make check-4
```

The script ends with a **Platform stability** section that flags pods with suspicious restart counts. You can also scan the worst offenders yourself — this lists the fifteen pods with the highest restart counts cluster-wide, which is useful when something feels slow but you are not sure which namespace is struggling:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A --sort-by='.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount' \
  -o custom-columns='NS:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,RESTARTS:.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount' \
  | tail -15
```

**The gate:** Kyverno controllers and other platform pods should show **RESTARTS under 5** after the stage settles. If any platform pod is climbing past 10, stop and fix it with the documented Helm values or [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) — do not `kubectl patch` around it and move on. A stable platform layer is a prerequisite for every stage that follows.

---

### 4.1 — Install Kyverno

```bash
helm repo add kyverno https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install kyverno kyverno/kyverno \
  --version 3.2.8 \
  --namespace kyverno \
  --create-namespace \
  -f stages/stage-4-admission-control/infra/kyverno/values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout=600s
```

The values file does three important things for the lab:

1. **Disables cleanup CronJobs** — older Kyverno charts pull `bitnami/kubectl`, which was removed from Docker Hub and causes `ImagePullBackOff` on cleanup pods.
2. **Points Helm hooks at `bitnamilegacy/kubectl`** — so future `helm uninstall` does not hang on a missing image.
3. **Extends liveness probe timeouts** — the default `timeoutSeconds: 5, failureThreshold: 2` is too tight for a loaded single-node VM. Under CPU pressure the health endpoint can take >5s to respond, which triggers a restart cascade that saturates the node and makes the API server intermittently unreachable. The values file sets `timeoutSeconds: 30, failureThreshold: 5` so Kyverno survives load spikes without crash-looping.

**What you should see:**

```
Release "kyverno" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: kyverno
NAMESPACE: kyverno
STATUS: deployed
...
Kyverno version: v1.12.6
```

Verify all four controllers are running (first pull can take several minutes on a slow connection):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kyverno
```

```
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kyverno-admission-controller-bd685cd4b-f6kl6     1/1     Running   0          2m
kyverno-background-controller-66fcfc6d87-59wgt   1/1     Running   0          2m
kyverno-cleanup-controller-5c5bf8bc6b-7kspq      1/1     Running   0          2m
kyverno-reports-controller-5cdd6f4c48-qf5wc      1/1     Running   0          2m
```

If pods stay in `ContainerCreating` for a long time, the node is still pulling images from `ghcr.io/kyverno`. Wait — do not start a second Helm install on top of a partial one.

**Stability gate — Kyverno install only (before §4.2):**

Do **not** run `make check-4` or `bash scripts/health-check.sh 4` here — that script also checks that all five policies are applied and enforcing (§4.3), so it will fail until you have done that work. Use it at the end of the stage in **§4.8**.

Right after Helm finishes, confirm only that the Kyverno controllers are healthy:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kyverno
```

All four controllers should be `1/1 Running` with **RESTARTS 0–2** (not climbing). If restarts keep increasing, the node is likely under CPU pressure and Kyverno’s health probes are killing pods — confirm you installed with `stages/stage-4-admission-control/infra/kyverno/values.yaml` (extended probe timeouts). See `docs/troubleshooting.md` §Stage 4.

If you want the cluster-wide restart picture at this point (optional), use the command in [Platform stability — from Stage 4 onward](#platform-stability--from-stage-4-onward) above — Kyverno and `hostpath-provisioner` should not be climbing past single digits while you continue to §4.2.

---

### 4.2 — Confirm your Cosign public key is in the policy

Stage 3 created `infra/cosign.pub`. Kyverno uses that same key to verify image signatures when a pod is created. The policy file ships with a placeholder — you must replace it with **your** key before applying policies in §4.3.

**Step 1 — Show your key (run from the repo root on the VM)**

```bash
cd ~/clearledger    # or wherever you cloned the repo
cat infra/cosign.pub
```

You should see three lines: `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`, a long base64 line, and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`. Copy that whole block (you will paste it in the next step).

**Step 2 — Paste the key into the policy**

Open `infra/policies/require-signed-images.yaml` in your editor (`nano`, `vim`, or VS Code).

Find this line:

```yaml
                      PASTE_YOUR_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
```

Delete **only** that placeholder line and paste the three lines from `cosign.pub` in its place. The result should look like this (your base64 line will differ):

```yaml
                - keys:
                    publicKeys: |-
                      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                      MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE...
                      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Save the file. The `BEGIN` / `END` lines must keep the spaces in front of them — that is normal YAML indentation.

**Step 3 — Verify (three quick checks)**

Run these one at a time from the repo root:

```bash
# Check A — placeholder must be gone
grep PASTE_YOUR_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE infra/policies/require-signed-images.yaml \
  && echo "❌ FAIL: placeholder still in file — edit and save again" \
  || echo "✓ OK: placeholder removed"
```

```bash
# Check B — key block must be present exactly once
grep -c "BEGIN PUBLIC KEY" infra/policies/require-signed-images.yaml
```

Expected output for Check B: `1` (if you see `0`, the key was not pasted; if `2`, you pasted it twice).

```bash
# Check C — policy key must match cosign.pub byte-for-byte
diff infra/cosign.pub \
  <(sed -n '/-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----/,/-----END PUBLIC KEY-----/p' \
      infra/policies/require-signed-images.yaml | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//')
```

Expected output for Check C: **nothing** — no diff lines means the keys match. If `diff` prints differences, open the policy file and fix the paste.

**All three passed?** Continue to §4.3.

**If you skip this**, Scenario 3 in §4.4 fails in a confusing way — unsigned images may slip through, or signed pods may be rejected because Kyverno is checking against the wrong key.

---

### 4.3 — Apply the five core policies

Apply the five policies that map to CIS controls. **Do not** apply `verify-slsa-provenance.yaml` yet — it is an optional SLSA attestation policy (Audit mode) for a later enhancement.

The `require-signed-images` policy includes `failurePolicy: Fail` and `webhookTimeoutSeconds: 30` — without these, Kyverno may allow pods through when signature verification cannot reach the registry.

```bash
kubectl apply \
  -f infra/policies/disallow-root.yaml \
  -f infra/policies/disallow-privilege-escalation.yaml \
  -f infra/policies/drop-all-capabilities.yaml \
  -f infra/policies/require-resource-limits.yaml \
  -f infra/policies/require-signed-images.yaml
```

Wait a few seconds, then confirm all policies show `READY: True` and `VALIDATE ACTION: Enforce`:

```bash
kubectl get clusterpolicy
```

```
NAME                            ADMISSION   BACKGROUND   VALIDATE ACTION   READY   AGE
disallow-privilege-escalation   true        true         Enforce           True    10s
disallow-root-containers        true        true         Enforce           True    10s
drop-all-capabilities           true        true         Enforce           True    10s
require-resource-limits         true        true         Enforce           True    10s
require-signed-images           true        false        Enforce           True    10s
```

If `READY` stays empty, check Kyverno logs: `kubectl logs -n kyverno -l app.kubernetes.io/component=admission-controller --tail=50`.

---

### 4.4 — Break it on purpose (the aha moment)

These three scenarios are deliberate **negative tests**. You submit a manifest you *know* is bad and confirm Kyverno rejects it **before the pod exists**. That is different from CI: Checkov told you the problem in a report; Kyverno stops the cluster from ever running the workload.

Each scenario removes or violates one control. Read the denial message — it names the policy, the rule, and the field that failed. That message is audit evidence.

| Scenario | What you simulate | Policy under test | Success looks like |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Attacker applies a bare pod (no hardening) | Root, caps, privilege, limits | Four policies fire; pod `NotFound` |
| 2 | Developer fixes securityContext but forgets limits | Resource limits only | One policy fires; pod `NotFound` |
| 3 | Attacker pushes unsigned image to Docker Hub | Cosign signature | `require-signed-images` denies; pod `NotFound` |

#### Scenario 1 — root container (no securityContext)

**What you are simulating:** Someone with `kubectl` access bypasses CI and applies a minimal pod — no `securityContext`, no resource limits. This is exactly what Stage 1 Checkov flagged as evidence; Stage 4 now **blocks** it.

**What is wrong with this manifest:** The container has only a name and image. It will run as root by default, keep all Linux capabilities, and has no CPU/memory bounds.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: root-test
  namespace: clearledger
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: nginx:alpine
EOF
```

**What you should see:**

```
Error from server: error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "validate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Pod/clearledger/root-test was blocked due to the following policies

disallow-privilege-escalation:
  check-allowPrivilegeEscalation: 'validation error: allowPrivilegeEscalation must
    be set to false. rule check-allowPrivilegeEscalation failed at path /spec/containers/0/securityContext/'
disallow-root-containers:
  check-runAsNonRoot: |-
    validation error: Root containers are blocked in the clearledger namespace. Set securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true on the pod or container.
    . rule check-runAsNonRoot failed at path /spec/containers/0/securityContext/
drop-all-capabilities:
  check-capabilities: 'validation error: All containers must drop ALL capabilities.
    rule check-capabilities failed at path /spec/containers/0/securityContext/'
require-resource-limits:
  check-resources: 'validation error: Resource requests and limits are required for
    all containers. rule check-resources failed at path /spec/containers/0/resources/limits/'
```

**How to read this output:**

- `validate.kyverno.svc-fail denied the request` — the API server rejected the create; nothing was stored in etcd as a running pod.
- Four separate policies each list a **rule name** and the **JSON path** that failed (`/spec/containers/0/securityContext/` etc.).
- One sloppy manifest hits four CIS-aligned controls at once — that is defense in depth.

**Verify enforcement worked:**

```bash
kubectl get pod root-test -n clearledger
# Error from server (NotFound): pods "root-test" not found
```

If you see a pod in `Running` or `Pending`, policies are not enforcing — re-check `kubectl get clusterpolicy` shows all five `READY: True`.

**Take a screenshot.** This is portfolio evidence for CIS Kubernetes Benchmark 5.2.6 — enforced, not just configured.

---

#### Scenario 2 — missing resource limits

**What you are simulating:** A developer who read the securityContext requirements and fixed root/caps/privilege — but skipped resource limits. Common in real teams: “we hardened the container” but forgot CPU/memory bounds.

**What is wrong with this manifest:** `securityContext` is correct, but there is no `resources.requests` or `resources.limits`. A container without limits can starve other workloads on the node.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nolimits-test
  namespace: clearledger
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: nginx:alpine
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        capabilities:
          drop: [ALL]
EOF
```

**What you should see:**

```
Error from server: error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "validate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Pod/clearledger/nolimits-test was blocked due to the following policies

require-resource-limits:
  check-resources: 'validation error: Resource requests and limits are required for
    all containers. rule check-resources failed at path /spec/containers/0/resources/limits/'
```

**How to read this output:**

- Only **one** policy appears this time — the earlier securityContext fields satisfied the other four rules.
- The failure path `/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/` tells you exactly what to add to fix the manifest.
- Compare this denial to Scenario 1: same webhook, fewer policies — Kyverno evaluates each rule independently.

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pod nolimits-test -n clearledger
# Error from server (NotFound): pods "nolimits-test" not found
```

---

#### Scenario 3 — unsigned ClearLedger image

**What you are simulating:** A supply-chain attack — someone pushes a malicious image to Docker Hub under your repo name (`clearledger-auth-service`) without going through your signed CI pipeline. Stage 3 made Cosign signing possible; Stage 4 makes it **mandatory** at the cluster gate.

**Why this scenario needs setup:** Kyverno verifies signatures against the **registry**, not your local machine. The image tag must **exist on Docker Hub**. A fake tag like `:unsigned` that was never pushed causes `ImagePullBackOff` after admission — that looks like a broken deploy, not a security block.

**Step 1 — push a deliberately unsigned test image** (one-time):

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username

docker pull nginx:alpine
docker tag nginx:alpine ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/clearledger-auth-service:unsigned-test
docker push ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/clearledger-auth-service:unsigned-test

# Must fail — proves the image has no Cosign signature from your pipeline key:
cosign verify --key infra/cosign.pub \
  index.docker.io/${DOCKER_USERNAME}/clearledger-auth-service:unsigned-test
# Error: no signatures found
```

**Step 2 — try to deploy it with a compliant pod spec:**

The pod manifest is fully hardened (securityContext + limits) so **only** the signature policy can fail. Use `index.docker.io/` in the image URL — on Kyverno 1.12, `docker.io/...` may not trigger `verifyImages` matching.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: unsigned-test
  namespace: clearledger
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: index.docker.io/${DOCKER_USERNAME}/clearledger-auth-service:unsigned-test
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        capabilities:
          drop: [ALL]
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "50m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "200m"
EOF
```

**What you should see:**

```
Error from server: error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "mutate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Pod/clearledger/unsigned-test was blocked due to the following policies

require-signed-images:
  verify-cosign-signature: 'failed to verify image index.docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:unsigned-test:
    .attestors[0].entries[0].keys: no signatures found'
```

**How to read this output:**

- Note the webhook name is `mutate.kyverno.svc-fail`, not `validate` — image verification runs in Kyverno’s mutate pass (digest + signature check) before the pod is admitted.
- `no signatures found` means Kyverno reached Docker Hub, found the image, and confirmed it was **not** signed with your `infra/cosign.pub` key.
- The pod never exists — the attacker cannot get a shell even if the image is pullable.

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pod unsigned-test -n clearledger
# Error from server (NotFound): pods "unsigned-test" not found
```

**What you should NOT see** (these mean the test did not prove signature enforcement):

| Symptom | What went wrong |
|---|---|
| Pod created, then `ImagePullBackOff` | Tag does not exist on Docker Hub — complete Step 1 first |
| Pod created and `Running` | Image used `docker.io/...` instead of `index.docker.io/...` |
| No `require-signed-images` in the error | Policy not applied, or `cosign.pub` not embedded in the policy YAML |

**Contrast — signed image is allowed:**

When the image **is** signed by your pipeline and the pod spec is compliant, admission succeeds:

```bash
# Your deployed tag (signed in CI) — should start if spec is compliant:
kubectl get deployment auth-service -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
# docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/clearledger-auth-service:v0.1.0
```

Existing Deployments synced before policies existed keep running. New pods using your signed tags pass verification.

**Take a screenshot of the Scenario 3 denial** — it proves supply-chain enforcement, not just CI signing.

---

### 4.5 — Verify ClearLedger still works

Kyverno enforces on **new** pod creation. Existing deployments that already passed admission (or were synced before policies existed) keep running. Confirm your app pods are healthy:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger
```

```
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
auth-service-...                        1/1     Running   0          ...
frontend-...                            1/1     Running   0          ...
ledger-service-...                      1/1     Running   0          ...
notification-service-...                1/1     Running   0          ...
postgres-0                              1/1     Running   0          ...
redis-...                               1/1     Running   0          ...
```

If ingress is configured:

```bash
curl -s http://clearledger.local/auth/health | jq .
# {"status": "ok", "service": "auth-service"}
```

ArgoCD should still show **Synced** and **Healthy** — GitOps and admission control work together, not against each other.

---

### 4.6 — Policy exceptions (when a legitimate workload needs a bypass)

Kyverno blocks every pod that violates a policy. But what happens when a legitimate workload needs to bypass a specific rule?

PostgreSQL is the example. The official Postgres Alpine image uses a specific internal user (UID 70) to manage its data directory. The `disallow-root-containers` policy requires every pod to set `runAsNonRoot: true`. Postgres does set that — but if Kyverno is configured to also check specific UID ranges, or if the pod's security context does not satisfy the rule for any reason, Kyverno blocks it. The database cannot start, and the entire application fails.

You cannot weaken the policy cluster-wide to accommodate one database. That would let every pod bypass the rule. Instead, you create a **PolicyException** — a targeted exemption for exactly the pods that need it.

Open [`infra/policies/exceptions/postgres-root-exception.yaml`](../infra/policies/exceptions/postgres-root-exception.yaml) and read the comments. Here is what each section does:

**The `spec.exceptions` block** identifies which policy and rule to bypass:

```yaml
exceptions:
  - policyName: disallow-root-containers
    ruleNames:
      - check-runAsNonRoot
```

This says: "skip only the `check-runAsNonRoot` rule from the `disallow-root-containers` policy." Every other rule in that policy — and every other policy in the cluster — still enforces normally.

**The `spec.match` block** limits which resources get the exception:

```yaml
match:
  any:
    - resources:
        kinds:
          - Pod
        namespaces:
          - clearledger
        names:
          - postgres-*
```

Only pods named `postgres-*` (matching `postgres-0`, `postgres-1`, etc.), only in the `clearledger` namespace, only for the `Pod` resource kind. Everything else in the cluster still follows the strict policy.

**The annotations** are documentation for your team and auditors:

```yaml
annotations:
  reason: "Postgres alpine image requires UID 70 for data directory ownership"
  approved-by: "platform-team"
  review-date: "2026-01-01"
```

These have no technical effect — Kyverno ignores them. They exist so that six months from now, when someone asks "why does Postgres bypass this rule?", the answer is right there in the file.

**The rules for safe exceptions:**

1. **Scope narrowly** — target the exact resource that needs it, nothing more
2. **Commit to Git** — the exception is reviewed in a pull request, tracked in version history, and auditable
3. **Never weaken the policy itself** — the rule stays strict for everything else
4. **Review periodically** — exceptions should be temporary if possible, and re-evaluated on a schedule

Apply the exception **only if** Kyverno blocks your postgres pods:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/policies/exceptions/postgres-root-exception.yaml
```

Verify Kyverno still blocks other non-compliant pods (same denial as Scenario 1):

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: another-root-test
  namespace: clearledger
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: nginx:alpine
EOF
```

### 4.7 — CIS benchmark evidence (kube-bench)

**Where you are:** §4.1–4.4 installed Kyverno and proved it blocks bad pods. §4.7 is optional **compliance evidence** — it does not change what runs in the cluster. After this, run **`make check-4`** in §4.8.

#### Two different security layers (do not mix them up)

| Layer | Tool | What it checks | Stage 4 question it answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workloads** | Kyverno | Pods you deploy — root, limits, signed images | "Can this pod run?" |
| **Cluster config** | kube-bench | Kubelet, control plane, node settings (CIS benchmark) | "Is the Kubernetes node itself hardened?" |

Kyverno can be perfect while kube-bench still reports FAIL — and vice versa. Both matter for compliance narratives; only Kyverno blocks your app in this lab.

#### Run it

```bash
bash stages/stage-4-admission-control/scripts/run-kube-bench.sh
```

The script applies a Job in `kube-system`, waits for completion, saves JSON to `stages/stage-4-admission-control/scripts/kube-bench-report.json`, and compares your cluster against a **committed baseline** (`kube-bench-baseline.json`).

#### What “pass” looks like (your output is correct)

On MicroK8s you will see a long list of **FAIL** and **WARN** lines — **that is normal**. MicroK8s manages kubelet flags under `/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/`; kube-bench expects a different layout than a managed cloud EKS/GKE node. The lab does **not** ask you to fix every CIS FAIL on a single-node VM.

**Scroll to the last two lines.** You pass §4.7 when you see:

```text
kube-bench: 1 FAIL control(s) present (documented in baseline — no regressions).
kube-bench: no regressions vs baseline.
```

That means: known MicroK8s gaps are documented; you did not make the cluster **worse** than the baseline. Your terminal output matches this — **good sign.**

| Last lines | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `no regressions vs baseline` | ✓ Pass for the lab | Continue to §4.8 |
| `REGRESSION: … now=FAIL` | ✗ Something newly failed vs baseline | Read the control ID; fix or document before Stage 5 |
| Script exits non-zero | Regression or Job failed | Re-run; check `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l job-name=kube-bench` |

**Do not panic about:** kubelet permission FAILs (`4.1.x`), anonymous-auth FAILs (`4.2.x`), or the long WARN list (`5.x` workload checks kube-bench cannot fully verify on MicroK8s) — they are expected on this platform.

**Do panic about:** `REGRESSION:` lines or `make check-4` failing on kube-bench — that means a control that used to pass now fails.

#### Optional — inspect the report

```bash
# Full JSON (for portfolio / audit evidence)
ls -la stages/stage-4-admission-control/scripts/kube-bench-report.json
```

Fixing every CIS FAIL on MicroK8s is out of scope for this lab. In production you would remediate node config or accept documented exceptions; here the baseline captures “known state on lab hardware.”

---

### 4.8 — Health check

```bash
make check-4
```

**What you should see:**

```
▶ Stage 4 — Admission Control (Kyverno)
  ✓ Kyverno is running
  ✓ Policy disallow-root-containers — Enforce mode
  ✓ Policy require-resource-limits — Enforce mode
  ✓ Policy require-signed-images — Enforce mode
  ✓ Policy disallow-privilege-escalation — Enforce mode
  ✓ Policy drop-all-capabilities — Enforce mode
  ✓ Kyverno correctly rejects pods without securityContext
  ✓ kube-bench baseline exists (...)

All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.
```

If kube-bench reports regressions, run the script manually and update the baseline after reviewing — that diff is audit evidence.

If Kyverno install, policies, break-it scenarios, or `make check-4` fail, see [troubleshooting.md — Stage 4](troubleshooting.md#stage-4-admission-control-troubleshooting).

---

### Stage 4 complete — done checklist (move to Stage 5)

You are **done with Stage 4** when all of these are true:

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Kyverno running | `kubectl get pods -n kyverno` — four controllers `Running` |
| 2 | Policies applied | `kubectl get clusterpolicy` — five policies, `READY: True`, `Enforce` |
| 3 | Root pod blocked | Scenario 1 denial in terminal (screenshot for portfolio) |
| 4 | Unsigned image blocked | Scenario 3 denial — push `unsigned-test` tag first, use `index.docker.io/` |
| 5 | App still healthy | `kubectl get pods -n clearledger` — all app pods `Running` |
| 6 | Health check green | `make check-4` ends with **`All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.`** |

**Recommended for portfolio (optional):**

- Screenshot of Kyverno blocking a root pod (§4.4 Scenario 1)
- Screenshot of unsigned-image denial (§4.4 Scenario 3)
- Screenshot of `kubectl get clusterpolicy` showing five `Enforce` policies

**What Stage 4 does *not* require yet:**

- `verify-slsa-provenance.yaml` (optional SLSA attestation — Audit mode, enable later)
- Vault / runtime secrets (Stage 5)
- Network policies (Stage 6)

**What “move to Stage 5” means:** Pods are hardened and images are signed, but database passwords still live in Kubernetes Secrets committed to Git. Stage 5 moves credentials into Vault.

### What you learned in Stage 4

- The difference between CI scanning (before merge) and admission control (at the cluster gate)
- What Kyverno is: a policy engine that intercepts every Kubernetes API request
- That enforcement means the bad resource never exists — not "we detected it after the fact"
- How to read a Kyverno denial: policy name → rule name → JSON path that failed
- How to write and apply cluster-wide security policies as YAML
- How to scope a PolicyException without weakening the policy for everyone else
- That operational issues (Helm, image pulls, registry URL format) affect whether controls actually fire
- **Why both CI and admission control are needed:** CI catches problems in your code; Kyverno catches everything else that touches the cluster

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Enforced admission control with Kyverno — blocking root containers, privilege escalation, unsigned images, and missing resource limits at deploy time — mapped to CIS Kubernetes benchmarks.

### DevSecOps lesson — Stage 4

**CI is the front door; admission control is the bouncer.** Stage 3 proved your pipeline signs images and scans manifests — but anyone with `kubectl apply` could bypass all of it. Kyverno closes that gap: every pod creation is evaluated against CIS-aligned policies before it runs. Checkov findings that were evidence-only in Stage 1 are now live enforcement. Cosign signatures that were non-blocking in Stage 1 are now required at deploy time.

**Evidence beats configuration.** An auditor does not care that you *have* a policy file in Git — they care that a non-compliant pod is rejected when someone tries to create it. The break-it scenarios produce that evidence: a terminal error naming the policy, the rule, and the failed field. Screenshot those denials. They prove CIS 5.2.x and supply-chain controls are **enforced**, not just documented.

**Defense in depth has a order.** CI → GitOps → admission control are three gates on the same path. Each catches what the previous one misses: CI never sees a manual `kubectl apply`; GitOps does not validate image signatures; Kyverno does not scan source code. Stacking all three is normal in regulated environments — no single gate is enough.

**Save your VM before Stage 5.** After `make check-4` passes:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=4
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage4 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=4`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 5 — Secrets Management (Vault)

> By the end of this stage, sensitive values no longer live in Git or in etcd-backed Kubernetes Secrets — Vault holds them centrally and injects them into pods only when they start.

Until now, database passwords and JWT keys lived in Kubernetes Secrets — and those Secret manifests were committed to `clearledger-infra` on GitHub. Anyone with repo access could decode them (base64 is not encryption), and etcd stores them unencrypted by default. **Stage 5 moves the source of truth into HashiCorp Vault** and proves the app still works after you delete the Kubernetes Secrets.

**Your goal:** remove `auth-service-secret` and `ledger-service-secret` from the cluster. Login and API calls must still work because Vault injects credentials at pod startup — that is the moment secrets management clicks.

**Before you start**, confirm Stage 4 is solid: `make check-4` passes, all five Kyverno policies are enforcing, the §4.4 break-it tests denied bad pods, and the app still responds at `http://clearledger.local`. Kyverno controllers should be `1/1 Running` with restarts under five (see [Platform stability — from Stage 4 onward](#platform-stability--from-stage-4-onward)). If auth or ledger pods are already crash-looping, fix that before installing Vault.

**You are done with Stage 5** when `make check-5` passes, the Kubernetes app Secrets are deleted, and you can still log in — credentials are coming from Vault-injected files under `/vault/secrets/`, not from `secretKeyRef`. Save your progress with `make snapshot STAGE=5` followed by `make snapshots` and confirm `clearledger.stage5` appears in the list.

### What changes in this stage

Right now, database passwords and JWT keys sit in `secret.yaml` files on GitHub and in Kubernetes Secrets inside the cluster. In Stage 5 you move those values into **HashiCorp Vault** and teach the app to read them a different way.

When an auth or ledger pod starts, the **Vault agent injector** adds a small sidecar container. That sidecar logs into Vault using the pod’s own service account, fetches the password and JWT, and writes them as files under `/vault/secrets/`. Your app already knows how to read those paths — it is the same data that used to arrive via `secretKeyRef`, just delivered at runtime instead of pulled from a Kubernetes Secret object.

Once migration is complete, sensitive values live in **Vault** (the long-term store) and briefly on the **pod filesystem** while the container runs. They are **not** in Git anymore — you remove `secret.yaml` from `clearledger-infra` and ArgoCD syncs deployments that point at Vault instead.

To load Vault the first time, you copy a template to a local **`.env` file** (§5.1). That file is gitignored. You run `seed-vault-secrets.sh` once to copy those values into Vault. Nothing secret is hardcoded in scripts that get committed.

### Do the steps in this order

Each step depends on the one before it. Skipping ahead is the most common way to get red auth/ledger pods that look like a broken app but really mean “Vault is not ready yet.”

1. **§5.1** — copy `stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env.example` to `.env`, then fill it with your cluster passwords
2. **§5.2** — install Vault and the agent injector with Helm
3. **§5.3** — run `setup.sh`, then `seed-vault-secrets.sh` (passwords now live in Vault)
4. **§5.4** — push Vault-enabled deployments to `clearledger-infra`; let ArgoCD sync
5. **§5.5** — wait for **2/2** pods (app + Vault sidecar), then delete the old Kubernetes Secrets
6. **§5.5b** — ArgoCD **Synced / Healthy** (after secret delete — OutOfSync before delete is normal)
7. **§5.6** — confirm login works and credentials appear under `/vault/secrets/` inside the pod

If pods fail after step 4 but Vault is not installed or seeded yet, go back — do not patch deployment YAML until you have completed steps 2 and 3.

Start at **§5.1**. If anything fails, read [troubleshooting.md — Stage 5](troubleshooting.md#stage-5--common-issues) before changing manifests.

---

### 5.1 — Create `.env` (local only, never commit)

This file holds two things: a **dev Vault root token** for Helm (§5.2), and the **passwords you will load into Vault** in §5.3. It stays on your machine only — never commit it. The `SEED_*` values must match what the app uses today so login still works after you delete Kubernetes Secrets later.

**Two different files — do not mix them up:**

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env.example`** | Blank template in the repo (empty fields). **Copy this** in step 1. |
| **`stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env`** | Your real file (gitignored). You create it and fill it in steps 2–3. |

The sample block at the bottom of this section is **only a picture** of what a completed `.env` looks like — do **not** copy those placeholder passwords unless they happen to match your cluster.

**Step 1 — copy the template to `.env`**

```bash
cp stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env.example \
   stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env
```

That gives you a file with empty `VAULT_TOKEN=` and `SEED_*=` lines. Open it in your editor for steps 2–3.

**Step 2 — read the current passwords from the cluster**

Run these from the repo root. Each command prints one value — copy the output into `.env` in step 3.

```bash
# → paste as SEED_AUTH_DATABASE_URL
kubectl get secret auth-service-secret -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.database_url}' | base64 -d; echo

# → paste as SEED_AUTH_JWT_SECRET
kubectl get secret auth-service-secret -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.jwt_secret}' | base64 -d; echo

# → paste as SEED_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL
kubectl get secret ledger-service-secret -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.database_url}' | base64 -d; echo
```

**Step 3 — fill in `.env`**

| Variable | What to put |
|---|---|
| `VAULT_TOKEN` | Any dev-only string you choose (e.g. `my-dev-root-token`) — same value in §5.2 Helm install |
| `SEED_AUTH_DATABASE_URL` | Output of first command above |
| `SEED_AUTH_JWT_SECRET` | Output of second command |
| `SEED_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL` | Output of third command |

**Sample only — shape of a completed `.env`** (use **your** kubectl output from step 2, not these example strings unless they match):

```text
VAULT_TOKEN=my-dev-root-token
SEED_AUTH_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clearledger:changeme-stage0@postgres:5432/clearledger
SEED_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=stage0-jwt-secret-change-in-production
SEED_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clearledger:changeme-stage0@postgres:5432/clearledger
```

**If `auth-service-secret` is already deleted** (you skipped ahead — recover like this):

```bash
# Database URL from Postgres bootstrap secret (lab default password is often changeme-stage0)
PG_PASS=$(kubectl get secret postgres-secret -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d)
echo "postgresql://clearledger:${PG_PASS}@postgres:5432/clearledger"
# Use that line for both SEED_AUTH_DATABASE_URL and SEED_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL

# JWT — same value you used at Stage 0, or read from Vault if you already seeded:
kubectl exec -n vault vault-0 -- vault kv get -field=jwt_secret clearledger/auth-service 2>/dev/null \
  || echo "(set SEED_AUTH_JWT_SECRET manually — must match tokens already issued)"
```

Continue to **§5.2** once `.env` has all four variables set.

---

### 5.2 — Install Vault and the agent injector

```bash
set -a && source stages/stage-5-secrets-management/.env && set +a

helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com && helm repo update

# First install:
helm install vault hashicorp/vault \
  --namespace vault --create-namespace \
  --set server.dev.enabled=true \
  --set server.dev.devRootToken="${VAULT_TOKEN}" \
  --set ui.enabled=true \
  --set injector.enabled=true

# If helm install fails with "cannot re-use a name", use upgrade instead:
# helm upgrade --install vault hashicorp/vault \
#   --namespace vault --create-namespace \
#   --set server.dev.enabled=true \
#   --set server.dev.devRootToken="${VAULT_TOKEN}" \
#   --set ui.enabled=true \
#   --set injector.enabled=true

kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vault -n vault --timeout=120s
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vault-agent-injector -n vault --timeout=120s

kubectl apply -f stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/vault-ingress.yaml
```

Open `http://vault.local` and sign in with **`VAULT_TOKEN` from your `.env`**.

**Verify — list Vault pods:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n vault
```

**Expected — Vault pods:**

```text
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
vault-0                                1/1     Running   0          1m
vault-agent-injector-8d6b668b4-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          1m
```

**If `helm install` fails with “cannot re-use a name”** — Vault is already installed; use the `helm upgrade --install` block above.

---

### 5.3 — Configure Vault (platform + seed KV)

Run both scripts in order. Each reads **`VAULT_TOKEN` from your `.env`**.

```bash
bash stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/vault/setup.sh
bash stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/vault/seed-vault-secrets.sh
```

**`setup.sh`** — prepares Vault for the cluster: Kubernetes auth, the KV secret store, policies, and roles so auth/ledger pods *can* fetch secrets later. It does not write your database passwords yet and nothing goes to Git.

**`seed-vault-secrets.sh`** — takes the `SEED_*` lines from `.env` and stores them in Vault at `clearledger/data/auth-service` and `clearledger/data/ledger-service`. It does not echo those values to the terminal.

Re-running either script is safe for the lab.

**Expected — `setup.sh` (tail):**

```text
==> Enabling Kubernetes auth method...
==> Configuring Kubernetes auth...
==> Enabling KV secrets engine...
==> Creating Vault policies...
==> Creating Kubernetes auth roles...
==> Applying RBAC + ServiceAccounts...

✓ Vault platform setup complete (no secrets written yet).
  Next: bash stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/vault/seed-vault-secrets.sh
```

**Expected — `seed-vault-secrets.sh`:**

```text
==> Logging into Vault...
==> Writing secrets to Vault KV (values are not printed)...
Secret Path
clearledger/data/auth-service
Metadata
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2026-06-01T15:31:53.538991153Z
version            1
✓ Secrets stored at clearledger/data/auth-service and clearledger/data/ledger-service
```

**Verify metadata only** (no secret values printed):

```bash
kubectl exec -n vault vault-0 -- vault kv metadata get clearledger/auth-service
```

```text
Key                     Value
---                     -----
cas_required            false
created_time            2026-06-01T15:31:53.538991153Z
current_version         1
delete_version_after    0s
max_versions            0
oldest_version          0
updated_time            2026-06-01T15:31:53.538991153Z
```

---

### 5.4 — GitOps: update `clearledger-infra` (fixes ArgoCD OutOfSync)

ArgoCD deploys from your **`clearledger-infra`** GitHub repo — not from the main **`clearledger`** app repo where you are working now. You edit manifests here first, then copy the same changes to `clearledger-infra` so ArgoCD can sync them. Work slowly and verify after each sub-step.

**5.4a — Update manifests in the app repo (`clearledger`)**

```bash
cp stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml \
   infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml
cp stages/stage-5-secrets-management/infra/manifests/ledger-service/deployment.yaml \
   infra/manifests/ledger-service/deployment.yaml
mkdir -p infra/manifests/vault
cp infra/deferred-by-stage/stage-5-secrets-management/vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml \
   infra/manifests/vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml
rm -f infra/manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml infra/manifests/ledger-service/secret.yaml
```

**5.4b — Edit `infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml` by hand**

Open the file in your editor. In the `resources:` list:

- **Remove** the app secret entries — delete these two lines, or comment them out with `#` (both work; Kustomize ignores `#` lines):
  ```yaml
  - auth-service/secret.yaml
  - ledger-service/secret.yaml
  ```
- **Add** this line (with the other resources):
  ```yaml
  - vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml
  ```

Leave **`postgres/postgres-secret.yaml`** — that is Postgres bootstrap only, not app credentials.

Save. Verify:

```bash
# Active (uncommented) app secret lines must be gone — postgres-secret is OK
grep -E '^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]+(auth-service|ledger-service)/secret\.yaml' \
  infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml && echo "STOP: app secrets still active" || echo "OK"

grep vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml
grep vault.hashicorp infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml | head -1
kustomize build infra/manifests >/dev/null && echo "OK: kustomize build"
```

Expected: `OK`; rotation cronjob listed; first line shows `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject`; kustomize build succeeds.

Commit in the **app** repo when ready: `git add infra/manifests && git commit -m "feat(stage-5): Vault deployments in canonical manifests"`.

**5.4c — Push the same changes to `clearledger-infra`**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git /tmp/clearledger-infra
```

If clone fails with **`destination path '/tmp/clearledger-infra' already exists`** (you cloned in §1.3 or an earlier step), reuse that folder — do not clone again:

```bash
cd /tmp/clearledger-infra && git pull && cd -
```

Or start fresh: `rm -rf /tmp/clearledger-infra` then run `git clone` again.

**Run the `cp` commands from the main `clearledger` app repo** — not from `/tmp/clearledger-infra`. Your shell prompt should say `clearledger`, not `clearledger-infra`. The source path `infra/manifests/...` only exists in the app repo.

```bash
cd ~/clearledger    # main app repo — adjust path if yours differs

cp infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/auth-service/
cp infra/manifests/ledger-service/deployment.yaml /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/ledger-service/
mkdir -p /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/vault
cp infra/manifests/vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/vault/
cp infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/kustomization.yaml
rm -f /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml
rm -f /tmp/clearledger-infra/manifests/ledger-service/secret.yaml

cd /tmp/clearledger-infra
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "feat(stage-5): Vault injection; remove app secrets from GitOps"
git push
cd -
```

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — Stage 5 GitOps landed**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger-infra.git /tmp/verify-s5
test ! -f /tmp/verify-s5/manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml && echo "OK: app secret removed from Git"
grep vault.hashicorp /tmp/verify-s5/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml | head -1
grep vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml /tmp/verify-s5/manifests/kustomization.yaml
rm -rf /tmp/verify-s5
```

Expected: `OK`; Vault annotation present; rotation job in kustomization.

**Expected — `git status` before commit (step 5.4c):**

```text
modified:   manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml
modified:   manifests/ledger-service/deployment.yaml
modified:   manifests/kustomization.yaml
new file:   manifests/vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml
deleted:    manifests/auth-service/secret.yaml
deleted:    manifests/ledger-service/secret.yaml
```

After `git push`, ArgoCD will roll out Vault-enabled deployments automatically. **Continue to §5.5** — do not expect **Synced** yet; app secrets still in the cluster until you delete them there.

**Common rollout failures:**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Duplicate value: "vault-secrets"` | Do **not** declare a `vault-secrets` volume in `deployment.yaml` — the injector creates it |
| `Service appeared 2 times` | Keep `Service` only in `service.yaml`, not at the bottom of `deployment.yaml` |
| Kyverno `containers/0` `runAsNonRoot` | Add `runAsNonRoot: true` on the **app** container `securityContext`, not only on `spec.securityContext` |
| Pods stuck `1/1` (no sidecar) | Confirm `injector.enabled=true` and deployment has `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"` |
| `permission denied` in vault-agent-init | Run `setup.sh` — K8s auth role not bound to service account |
| ArgoCD **Sync failed** on `CronJob/vault-secret-rotation` | Kyverno blocked the job — `infra/manifests/vault/rotation-cronjob.yaml` must include `runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, and CPU/memory limits; push fix to `clearledger-infra` |

---

### 5.5 — Wait for Vault-injected pods, then delete K8s app Secrets

**Wait until auth/ledger show Vault sidecars** (`READY 2/2` = app + vault-agent):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=ledger-service
```

**Expected:**

```text
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
auth-service-5756d9fcb9-bmdlr   2/2     Running   0          2m
auth-service-5756d9fcb9-jtgss   2/2     Running   0          2m
```

Inspect sidecar pulled secrets (init container logs):

```bash
kubectl logs -n clearledger \
  $(kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -o name | head -1) \
  -c vault-agent-init
# ... Authentication successful, rendering templates ...
```

**Only after pods are 2/2**, delete app Secrets:

```bash
kubectl delete secret auth-service-secret ledger-service-secret -n clearledger
```

**Expected — secrets remaining:**

```bash
kubectl get secret -n clearledger
```

```text
NAME              TYPE     DATA   AGE
postgres-secret   Opaque   2      6d
```

`postgres-secret` is **Postgres bootstrap only** — not app credentials. That stays until you harden Postgres separately.

**If delete says `NotFound`** — secrets were already removed. Continue to §5.6.

### 5.5b — ArgoCD should be Synced (after secret delete)

**Run this after §5.5**, not right after §5.4. Before you delete app Secrets, **OutOfSync is normal** — Git no longer lists `auth-service-secret` / `ledger-service-secret`, but they still exist in the cluster until you delete them in the step above.

```bash
kubectl get application clearledger -n argocd \
  -o jsonpath='sync={.status.sync.status} health={.status.health.status}{"\n"}'
```

**Before secret delete:** expect `sync=OutOfSync health=Healthy` or `Progressing` while Vault pods roll out — that is fine if auth/ledger are **2/2**.

**After secret delete**, hard-refresh and sync if still OutOfSync:

```bash
kubectl annotate application clearledger -n argocd argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
argocd app sync clearledger --grpc-web --prune
```

If sync says **another operation is already in progress**, wait a minute — ArgoCD auto-sync is already running.

Wait until:

```bash
kubectl get application clearledger -n argocd \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.sync.status} {.status.health.status}{"\n"}'
# Synced Healthy
```

**Do not `kubectl apply` deployments** if ArgoCD manages the cluster — `selfHeal` reverts manual changes. Git is the contract (Stage 2).

---

### 5.6 — The aha moment (login + injected files)

```bash
kubectl exec -n clearledger \
  $(kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -o name | head -1) \
  -c auth-service -- ls /vault/secrets/
```

```text
database_url
jwt_secret
```

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@clearledger.io","password":"SecurePass123"}' | jq .
```

**Expected:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "<jwt-returned-by-auth-service>",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

**Take a screenshot:** working login JSON + `kubectl get secret -n clearledger` showing **no** `auth-service-secret` / `ledger-service-secret`.

---

### 5.7 — Health check

```bash
make check-5
```

**What you should see:**

```text
▶ Stage 4 — Admission Control (Kyverno)
  ✓ Kyverno is running
  ✓ Policy disallow-root-containers — Enforce mode
  ...
  ✓ kube-bench matches baseline (no new FAIL regressions)

▶ Stage 5 — Secrets Management (Vault)
  ✓ Vault pod is running
  ✓ Vault agent injector is running
  ✓ Vault is unsealed
  ✓ Vault Kubernetes auth method is enabled
  ✓ auth-service-secret removed — Vault is the secret source
  ✓ Vault injected /vault/secrets/database_url into auth-service

All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.
```

If Vault injection or ArgoCD sync fails, see [troubleshooting.md — Vault Issues](troubleshooting.md#vault-issues).

---

### Stage 5 complete — done checklist (move to Stage 6)

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Secrets in Vault only | `vault kv metadata get clearledger/auth-service` shows `current_version >= 1` |
| 2 | No app secrets in infra Git | `secret.yaml` absent from `clearledger-infra/manifests/auth-service/` and `ledger-service/` |
| 3 | ArgoCD synced | `Synced Healthy` on Application `clearledger` |
| 4 | K8s app secrets deleted | `kubectl get secret -n clearledger` — no auth/ledger app secrets |
| 5 | Injection works | Auth pods `2/2`; `ls /vault/secrets/` shows `database_url`, `jwt_secret` |
| 6 | App works | Login curl returns `access_token` |
| 7 | Health check | `make check-5` ends with **`All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.`** |

**Recommended for portfolio (optional):**

- Screenshot: login JSON beside `kubectl get secret -n clearledger` (only `postgres-secret` left)
- Screenshot: auth pod `2/2` with Vault sidecar
- Screenshot: Vault UI signed in (token from `.env`, not pasted in Git)

**What Stage 5 does *not* require yet:**

- Moving `postgres-secret` into Vault (Postgres bootstrap — optional hardening later)
- Production Vault HA / auto-unseal (dev mode is intentional for the lab)
- Falco / runtime detection (**Stage 6**)

**What “move to Stage 6” means:** Credentials are out of Git and etcd, but a compromised pod can still read `/vault/secrets/*` at runtime. Stage 6 adds Falco to detect that.

### What you learned in Stage 5

- Why Kubernetes Secrets are not secret management (encoding ≠ encryption; etcd exposure)
- That **Vault KV** is the source of truth; `.env` is a one-time bootstrap channel, never committed
- How Vault agent injection works via deployment annotations and service account JWT
- That GitOps must drop `secret.yaml` from **`clearledger-infra`**, not only from the app repo
- That **order matters**: Vault ready → seed KV → GitOps → healthy pods → delete K8s Secrets
- **The security improvement:** app credentials are not in Git, not in etcd as K8s Secrets, and disappear when the pod stops

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Replaced Kubernetes Secrets with HashiCorp Vault agent injection so no credentials live in Git or etcd, and can explain runtime injection and rotation.

### DevSecOps lesson — Stage 5

**Secrets belong in a vault, not in YAML.** In Stage 4 you hardened what runs in the cluster. In Stage 5 you stop keeping credentials where attackers look first — in Git and in etcd-backed Kubernetes Secrets.

Install Vault, load passwords into it once from a local `.env` file (never committed), then deploy through GitOps without `secret.yaml`. When pods are healthy, delete the old Kubernetes Secrets and confirm login still works. That proves the app reads from Vault, not from the cluster.

Lab scripts only configure Vault — they do not contain real passwords. To rotate a secret, update Vault and let the agent refresh files on the pod. You do not change manifests in Git.

**Save your VM before Stage 6.** After `make check-5` passes:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=5
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage5 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=5`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 6 — Runtime Security (Falco)

> Stages 1–5 secured what gets deployed and how secrets are stored. Stage 6 watches what happens inside running containers after they start.

**Your goal** is to learn what runtime security catches and why it matters, then prove it by triggering a Falco alert and reading it the way an on-call engineer would.

CI, Kyverno, and Vault all act before or at pod startup. Falco fills the gap they leave open — it watches what running software actually does inside the container. That is the layer incident response and forensics care about, not just another chart to install.

> **Am I ready for Stage 6?**
>
> - [ ] `make check-5` passes — Vault is injecting secrets and app Secrets are gone from Git and the cluster
> - [ ] Login and transactions still work at `http://clearledger.local`
> - [ ] Platform pods are stable with low restarts ([platform stability](#platform-stability--from-stage-4-onward))
>
> **You are done** when you have triggered at least one Falco alert (§6.2 or §6.3), applied network policies (§6.4), and `make check-6` passes (§6.5).
>
> **Then save your VM:** `make snapshot STAGE=6`, then `make snapshots` — confirm `clearledger.stage6` is in the list.

### Do the steps in this order

Each step depends on the one before it. **Do not run `make check-6` until §6.4** — it checks network policies you have not applied yet.

1. **§6.1** — install Falco, open `http://falco.local`, confirm custom rules loaded
2. **§6.2** — run `make demo-6` and read a **Critical** shell alert in the UI (portfolio screenshot)
3. **§6.3** — optional manual break-it scenarios if you want step-by-step control
4. **§6.4** — apply network policies and confirm the app still works
5. **§6.5** — run `make check-6`

Start at **§6.1**. If anything fails, see [troubleshooting.md — Stage 6](troubleshooting.md#stage-6--runtime-security-falco).

**Optional reading (skip if you want to install now):** [How Stage 6 fits the full stack](#how-stage-6-fits-the-full-stack-stages-16) — why Falco and netpol exist and how they differ from Stages 3–5.

### Stage 6 (read this if you feel lost)

**What you are doing:** Install a watcher (Falco) that alerts when something suspicious happens *inside* a running pod — like someone opening a shell. Then prove it works by triggering an alert on purpose. Then lock down pod-to-pod traffic (network policies). Then run a health check.

**You do not need to understand every row in the Falco UI.** Most rows are background noise. You only need to find **one** alert you caused, or confirm it in the terminal.

**Copy-paste path (minimum — about 30 minutes):**

```bash
# 1. Install
bash stages/stage-6-runtime-security/scripts/install-falco.sh
kubectl get pods -n falco    # falco-* should be 2/2 Running

# 2. Confirm rules loaded
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -c falco --tail=200 \
  | grep 'rules.d/clearledger_rules'
# expect: schema validation: ok

# 3. Trigger demo + read terminal confirmation
make demo-6
# expect: ✓ Runtime detection confirmed

# 4. Prove the alert exists (UI optional)
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -c falco --tail=500 \
  | grep 'Shell Spawned'
# expect: pod=auth-service-... cmd=sh -c id && exit

# 5. Network policies + checkpoint + health check
kubectl apply -f infra/deferred-by-stage/stage-6-runtime-security/netpol/network-policies.yaml
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/   # expect 200
make check-6
```

Open **`http://falco.local`** (login `admin` / `admin`) when you want a screenshot for your portfolio — not because the lab requires you to decode the UI.

**“I feel lost” — common moments**

| You think… | What is actually true |
|---|---|
| “The UI shows 200+ Critical alerts — I broke something” | No. **`postgres-0`** reads `/etc/passwd` on a loop and Falco flags it. Ignore those rows. |
| “I cannot find my demo alert” | Search the UI with **Cmd+F → `Shell Spawned`**, or use the **terminal grep** in step 4 above. If grep shows `auth-service` + `id && exit`, you passed. |
| “`make check-6` failed on NetworkPolicy” | You ran the check **before §6.4**. Apply netpol first, then re-run. |
| “§6.3 vs §6.2 — which do I run?” | Run **`make demo-6` (§6.2)** only. §6.3 is the same attacks as manual commands — skip it if demo-6 already worked. |
| “What is Shell Spawned?” | Falco saw a **`sh` process start** inside `auth-service`. That is suspicious in production; in the lab, **you** caused it on purpose. |
| “Scenario 4 hangs or exit 137” | Old **`wget`** command + **Terminating** pod. Skip Scenario 4 or use the **python3** command in §6.4. Checkpoint + `make check-6` is enough. |

**What “done” looks like**

- Terminal after `make demo-6`: **`✓ Runtime detection confirmed`**
- Terminal grep: **`Shell Spawned`** + **`auth-service`** + **`id && exit`**
- After netpol: **`make check-6`** → **All checks passed**
- Optional portfolio: screenshot of that shell alert (or the grep output)

---

### 6.1 — Install Falco and Falcosidekick UI

```bash
bash stages/stage-6-runtime-security/scripts/install-falco.sh
```

This runs `helm upgrade --install` with `modern_ebpf`, enables Falcosidekick + Web UI, enables the **k8s-metacollector** (`collectors.kubernetes.enabled: true`) so custom rules can match `k8smeta.ns.name = clearledger`, loads rules from `infra/falco/clearledger-rules-content.yaml`, applies the rules ConfigMap and ingress.

**If Falco is already installed**, the script is safe to re-run (upgrade).

**Verify Falco pods:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n falco
```

**Expected output:**

```text
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
falco-w4fh6                               2/2     Running   0          2m
falco-falcosidekick-...                   1/1     Running   0          2m
falco-falcosidekick-ui-...                1/1     Running   0          2m
falco-falcosidekick-ui-redis-0            1/1     Running   0          2m
```

The Falco DaemonSet should show **2/2 Running**. Sidekick, UI, and Redis pods should each show **1/1 Running**. Pod name suffixes on your cluster will differ from the example.

Open **`http://falco.local`** — Falcosidekick UI. Log in with the chart defaults:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Login** | `admin` |
| **Password** | `admin` |

To read the credentials from the cluster instead of trusting the lab defaults:

```bash
kubectl get secret falco-falcosidekick-ui -n falco \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.FALCOSIDEKICK_UI_USER}' | base64 -d && echo
# admin:admin
```

#### Falcosidekick UI — quick orientation

After login you land on the **Events** tab. The table can look busy before you run any demo — that is normal.

- **Rule** — detection name (what fired)
- **Priority** — **Critical** / **Warning** / **Notice** (focus on Critical and Warning for this lab)
- **Output** — pod name, file, or command details
- **Tags** — look for `clearledger` on lab alerts

**Background noise you can ignore:** **Notice** rows from ArgoCD; **Critical** **Sensitive File Read** rows from **`postgres-0`** reading `/etc/passwd` (repeats every few seconds). Your demo alert is different — see §6.2.

**Verify custom rules loaded** (do this before §6.2):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n falco                                    # Falco pod 2/2 Running
kubectl get configmap clearledger-falco-rules -n falco
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -c falco --tail=200 \
  | grep 'rules.d/clearledger_rules'
```

**Expected:** `clearledger_rules.yaml | schema validation: ok`

An empty grep with `--tail=30` alone is **not** a failure — use `--tail=200`. If you see `LOAD_ERR_COMPILE_CONDITION`, see [troubleshooting.md — Stage 6](../docs/troubleshooting.md#stage-6--runtime-security-falco).

If rules did not load, §6.2 and §6.3 will look like they passed when nothing fired.

---

### 6.2 — Guided demo (`make demo-6`)

Run this **after** §6.1 (Falco installed, rules verified, UI opens at `http://falco.local`).

```bash
make demo-6
# or:
bash stages/stage-6-runtime-security/scripts/demo-falco-alerts.sh
```

#### What the script does (step by step)

| Step | What you see | What is happening |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Context** | “Why this demo exists” + attack story | Frames Stage 6 as runtime detection, not tool install |
| **2. Preflight** | Target pod name printed | Checks Falco namespace, Falcosidekick Redis, and a running `auth-service` pod exist |
| **3. Open UI** | Browser opens `http://falco.local` | Login: `admin` / `admin` — stay on **Events** tab |
| **4. Pause** | `Press Enter when logged in…` | Waits until you are ready (skipped if `SKIP_PROMPT=1`) |
| **5. Baseline** | `Events in UI now: N` | Records current event count; tells you to ignore Notice/argocd noise |
| **6. Pause** | `Press Enter when… noted the current count…` | Second pause so you can watch the UI before the trigger |
| **7. Countdown** | `3… 2… 1…` | Time to focus on the Events tab |
| **8. Trigger** | `uid=1000…` in terminal | Runs the same exec as §6.3 Scenario 1 (see command below) |
| **9. Confirm** | `Falco matching syscall → rule → UI store` then `✓ Runtime detection confirmed` | Polls Falcosidekick’s Redis store for a **new** event whose rule contains `Shell Spawned in ClearLedger` (not just a higher event count — ArgoCD Notice rows can inflate count without your alert) |
| **10. Triage hints** | “Now read the alert like an operator” | Checklist of Priority, Rule, Output fields — full detail in **“After the demo”** below |

**Exact command the script runs** (same as §6.3 Scenario 1):

```bash
kubectl exec -n clearledger \
  auth-service-<pod-suffix> \
  -c auth-service -- /bin/sh -c 'id && exit'
```

The script picks the pod name automatically (`-c auth-service` targets the app container, not the Vault sidecar).

**Non-interactive** (CI or no Enter prompts): `SKIP_PROMPT=1 make demo-6`

**Tip:** Split screen — terminal on the left, Events tab on the right. After step 9, **refresh the browser**; a new **Critical** row should appear at the top.

#### After the demo — find YOUR alert in a noisy UI

When the terminal prints `✓ Runtime detection confirmed`, refresh the Events tab. The UI may show **hundreds** of Critical rows — most are **postgres-0** reading `/etc/passwd` every few seconds. That is normal baseline noise, not your demo.

**What does “Shell Spawned” mean?**

A **shell** is a command interpreter — programs like `sh`, `bash`, or `dash` that run commands you type (or that a script passes in). **Spawned** means a **new process started** inside the container.

Your app container (`auth-service`) is meant to run the API — not open an interactive shell. When `make demo-6` runs `kubectl exec … /bin/sh -c 'id && exit'`, Falco sees a new `sh` process start inside that pod. The rule **Shell Spawned in ClearLedger Container** fires because:

- a shell binary (`sh`, `bash`, etc.) started (`spawned_process`)
- it happened inside a container in the `clearledger` namespace

In production, that often means someone got code execution — command injection, a compromised dependency, or an unauthorized `kubectl exec`. That is why the alert is **Critical**.

**What you want (memorize this):**

| Column | Your demo value |
|---|---|
| **Rule** | **Shell Spawned in ClearLedger Container** |
| **Pod** (in Output) | **auth-service-…** (not `postgres-0`) |
| **Command** (in Output) | **`cmd=sh -c id && exit`** |

**Not** `Sensitive File Read` + `postgres-0` — that is postgres background noise.

**Method 1 — Browser search (fastest)**

1. Open **`http://falco.local`** → **Events** tab.
2. Press **Cmd+F** (Mac) or **Ctrl+F** (Windows/Linux).
3. Search **`Shell Spawned`**. If nothing matches, try **`auth-service`** or **`sh -c id`**.

The browser jumps to the matching row.

**Method 2 — Filter by tag**

Your demo row has tag **`shell`**. Postgres noise rows have tag **`file-access`**. If the UI shows tag filters, pick **`shell`**.

**Method 3 — Terminal (always works)**

Skip the UI and pull the exact alert:

```bash
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -c falco --tail=500 \
  | grep 'Shell Spawned'
```

Look for `pod=auth-service-…` and `cmd=sh -c id && exit`. That proves the demo worked even when the UI is flooded.

**Method 4 — Re-run demo, then narrow time**

1. Note the current time.
2. Run **`make demo-6`** again.
3. In the UI, set the time range to **Last 15 minutes** (or **Last 1 hour**).
4. Search **`Shell Spawned`** or **`auth-service`**.

**Cheat sheet**

| You see this | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Sensitive File Read` + `postgres-0` + `/etc/passwd` | Ignore — postgres baseline |
| `Shell Spawned` + `auth-service` + `sh -c id && exit` | **Your demo — screenshot this** |

**What the story means:** You ran a shell inside `auth-service` — the same thing an attacker would do after exploiting the app. Kyverno and CI never saw it because nothing changed in Git or in the pod spec. Falco saw the `sh` process start inside the running container and fired your custom rule.

**Portfolio screenshot:** the **Shell Spawned** row on **auth-service** with `cmd=sh -c id && exit` visible — not the postgres Sensitive File Read rows.

---

### 6.3 — Break-it scenarios (manual, optional)

Same detections as §6.2, but you run each command yourself. Skip this section if you already completed `make demo-6`.

| Rule name | You trigger it by… |
|---|---|
| **Shell Spawned in ClearLedger Container** | Scenario 1 — `kubectl exec … /bin/sh` |
| **Sensitive File Read in ClearLedger** | Scenario 2 — `cat /etc/passwd` |
| **Package Manager / Outbound connection** | Scenario 3 — `wget` or `curl` |

After each command, refresh **`http://falco.local`** or use the find methods in §6.2.

**Scenario 1 — Shell in a running pod (command injection simulation):**

```bash
kubectl exec -n clearledger \
  $(kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -o name | head -1) \
  -c auth-service -- /bin/sh -c "id && exit"
```

**Expected in Falco UI / logs** (within ~10 seconds):

```text
CRITICAL: Shell spawned in ClearLedger container
  user=... container=auth-service pod=auth-service-... cmd=sh -c id && exit
```

**What this means:** Stage 4 allowed the pod (it is compliant). Stage 6 detected *behavior inside* the pod — exactly what an attacker would do after command injection.

**If you see no alert:** confirm the exec used `-c auth-service` (not the vault-agent sidecar), rules show `schema validation: ok`, and the pod image name contains `clearledger`.

**Scenario 2 — Read a sensitive file (reconnaissance):**

```bash
kubectl exec -n clearledger \
  $(kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -o name | head -1) \
  -c auth-service -- cat /etc/passwd
```

**Expected:**

```text
CRITICAL: Sensitive file read in ClearLedger
  file=/etc/passwd container=auth-service pod=auth-service-...
```

**Scenario 3 — Download tool at runtime (optional):**

```bash
kubectl exec -n clearledger \
  $(kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -o name | head -1) \
  -c auth-service -- sh -c "wget -q ifconfig.me -O - 2>/dev/null || true"
```

May fire **Package manager executed** and/or **Unexpected outbound connection** (WARNING).

**Take screenshots of Scenarios 1 and 2** — portfolio evidence for runtime detection.

---

### 6.4 — Apply network policies (zero-trust segmentation)

Network policies run **after** Falco demos (§6.2 / §6.3). **`make check-6` includes netpol checks — run it only after this section.**

Network policies are a **firewall between pods**. `default-deny-all` blocks everything; each `allow-*` policy opens specific paths (auth → postgres, ledger → auth, etc.). Falco **detects** bad behavior; netpol **blocks** traffic that should not happen.

**Apply:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/deferred-by-stage/stage-6-runtime-security/netpol/network-policies.yaml
kubectl get networkpolicy -n clearledger
```

**Expected:** seven policies — `default-deny-all` plus six `allow-*` (`auth-service`, `ledger-service`, `notification-service`, `postgres`, `redis`, `frontend`).

**Verify the app still works:**

```bash
curl -s http://clearledger.local/auth/health | jq .
# {"status":"ok","service":"auth-service"}

curl -s http://clearledger.local/notifications/health | jq .
# {"status":"ok",...}
```

**Checkpoint (required)** — proves netpol did not break the real app:

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicy -n clearledger
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/
kubectl get pods -n clearledger --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
```

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Seven policies listed | Netpol applied |
| `200` from curl | Users can still reach the app through ingress |
| Third command prints **nothing** | No crashed pods |

If auth or ledger start restarting after netpol, egress rules are too strict — see [troubleshooting.md — Stage 6](../docs/troubleshooting.md#stage-6--runtime-security-falco).

**Scenario 4 — blocked cross-service traffic (optional)**

Skip if the checkpoint passed and you plan to run `make check-6`. This proves ledger **cannot** call notification directly (no allow rule for that path). **Failure to connect is success.**

**Do not use the old `wget` one-liner** — the ledger image has no `wget`/`curl`, and `head -1` can pick a **Terminating** pod (exec hangs or exit **137**).

```bash
LEDGER_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=ledger-service --no-headers \
  | awk '$2=="2/2" && $3=="Running" {print $1; exit}')

echo "Using pod: $LEDGER_POD"

kubectl exec -n clearledger "$LEDGER_POD" -c ledger-service -- python3 -c "
import urllib.request
try:
    urllib.request.urlopen('http://notification-service/', timeout=5)
    print('UNEXPECTED: connection succeeded')
except Exception as e:
    print('BLOCKED (expected):', e)
"
```

**Expected:**

```text
BLOCKED (expected): <urlopen error timed out>
```

or `Connection refused` — **not** `UNEXPECTED: connection succeeded`.

---

### 6.5 — Health check

Run this **after §6.4** (network policies). It confirms Falco, custom rules, and netpol are installed — it does **not** prove an alert fired (that is §6.2).

```bash
make check-6
```

**What you should see:**

```text
▶ Stage 6 — Runtime Security (Falco)
  ✓ Falco DaemonSet: 1/1 nodes
  ✓ ClearLedger custom Falco rules ConfigMap exists
  ✓ NetworkPolicy default-deny-all exists
  ✓ NetworkPolicy allow-auth-service exists
  ✓ NetworkPolicy allow-ledger-service exists
  ✓ NetworkPolicy allow-notification-service exists
  ✓ auth-service reachable after network policies
  ✓ notification-service reachable after network policies

All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.
```

<a id="how-stage-6-fits-the-full-stack-stages-16"></a>

### How Stage 6 fits the full stack (optional reading)

Each stage guards a different point in the lifecycle. Stages 1 through 5 work before or during pod startup. Stage 6 watches what happens **inside** a container that is already running.

**Stage 3 — CI** catches bad code and images on `git push`. **Stage 4 — Kyverno** blocks bad pods at admission. **Stage 5 — Vault** injects secrets at startup. **Stage 6 — Falco** watches syscalls after the pod is running (shell spawns, sensitive file reads). **Stage 6 — Network policies** filter pod-to-pod traffic.

Three different questions: Kyverno asks whether this pod may be created. Falco asks what the pod is doing right now. Network policies ask who the pod may talk to. Falco does not replace CI or Kyverno — if you skip Stages 3–5, Falco can still alert, but you already shipped vulnerable code and secrets in Git.

---

### Stage 6 complete — done checklist (move to Stage 6.5 / 7)

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Falco running | `kubectl get pods -n falco` — DaemonSet `2/2` |
| 2 | Custom rules loaded | `kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -c falco --tail=200 \| grep rules.d/clearledger` |
| 3 | Shell alert fired **and you read it** | `make demo-6` → Critical row with `cmd=sh -c id && exit`, pod `auth-service-…` — §6.2 |
| 4 | Network policies applied | `kubectl get networkpolicy -n clearledger` — §6.4 |
| 5 | App still healthy | `curl` auth + notification health return 200 |
| 6 | Health check | `make check-6` green — §6.5 |

**Recommended for portfolio:** screenshots of shell + sensitive-file alerts in Falco UI.

**What “move to Stage 6.5 / 7” means:** Falco *detects* runtime threats; Stage 6.5 (optional) proves *resilience* under failure; Stage 7 correlates alerts in Grafana.

### What you learned in Stage 6

- What runtime security catches that CI and admission control cannot: threats inside running containers
- What Falco is: eBPF syscall monitoring with custom YAML rules
- What network policies are: Kubernetes firewall rules between pods
- How to trigger and interpret alerts — incident response skills
- **The full stack:** code scanning → admission control → secrets management → runtime detection → (next) observability

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Deployed Falco for runtime threat detection with custom rules, and can trigger and read an alert for a shell-in-container or sensitive-file read the way an on-call engineer would.

### DevSecOps lesson — Stage 6

**Detection at runtime closes the last gap on the node.** CI and Kyverno guard the path in; Vault guards credentials at rest in Git/etcd; Falco watches what processes *do* after a pod is running. Network policies add **prevention** while Falco adds **detection** — both are normal in regulated environments. The break-it scenarios produce audit evidence: named rules, pod, container, and command — exactly what you need when triaging a real incident.

**Save your VM before optional Stage 6.5 (Chaos) or Stage 7.** After §6.5 (`make check-6`) passes:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=6
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage6 — do not skip
```

**What next?**

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=6
make snapshots
```

Then go to **[Stage 7 — Observability](#stage-7--security-observability)**. Stage 6.5 (Litmus chaos) is optional — skip it unless you want resilience portfolio depth.

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=6`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 6.5 — Chaos Engineering (Optional)

> **Most learners skip this.** Go straight to [Stage 7](#stage-7--security-observability) after `make snapshot STAGE=6`. Nothing in Stages 7–8 requires Litmus.

### Skip to Stage 7

You are done with the required lab path when Stage 6 passes:

```bash
make check-6
make snapshot STAGE=6
make snapshots
```

Open [Stage 7](#stage-7--security-observability) — no Litmus install needed.

---

### Only continue below if you want chaos/resilience (~1 hour)

**What you will do:** Install **LitmusChaos**, delete one `auth-service` pod on purpose, and prove `/auth/health` stays **200** while Kubernetes replaces the pod.

**What Litmus is (first time here):** A chaos tool with a web UI at `http://litmus.local`. Falco (Stage 6) detects bad behavior. Litmus tests whether the app **survives** when a pod dies.

### Do the steps in this order

| Step | Section | What you do |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [§6.5.0](#650--before-you-start-fix-auth-service-restarts) | Auth pods **2/2 Ready** |
| 2 | [§6.5.1](#651--install-litmuschaos-operator-ui-cluster-connection) | Install Litmus, UI shows **Active 1** |
| 3 | [§6.5.2](#652--run-your-first-experiment-pod-delete) | Pod-delete experiment + `curl` stays 200 |
| 4 | [§6.5.7](#657--health-check) | `make check-65`, snapshot |

**Optional:** [§6.5.3](#653--same-experiment-from-the-terminal-make-demo-65) — same test via `make demo-65` instead of the UI wizard.

**Copy-paste path:**

```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME          # required for fix-65-prereqs
make fix-65-prereqs                    # auth 2/2 + netpol
bash stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/scripts/install-litmus.sh
open http://litmus.local               # admin / litmus
# §6.5.2 — ChaosHub → Pod Delete → Run (keep curl health=200 in a terminal)
make check-65
make snapshot STAGE=65
```

**Done when:** `make check-65` passes, or you skipped and went to Stage 7.

---

### 6.5.0 — Before you start (auth pods must be 2/2)

Chaos deletes pods. If replacements fail to start, you debug CrashLoopBackOff instead of learning resilience.

```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME   # required — without this, fix-argocd breaks ArgoCD repoURL
make fix-65-prereqs
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
```

**Pass:** two pods, both **2/2 Ready**. Do not install Litmus until this is true.

**If something fails:**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| ArgoCD **ComparisonError** after `fix-65-prereqs` | `kubectl apply -f stages/stage-2-gitops/argocd/clearledger-app.yaml` |
| Auth **Init:0/1**, Vault `permission denied` | Re-run Stage 5 `setup.sh` + `seed-vault-secrets.sh`, delete auth/ledger pods |
| Auth **1/2** or postgres timeout | `make fix-65-prereqs` again (adds netpol + startup probes) |

---

### 6.5.1 — Install LitmusChaos (operator, UI, cluster connection)

```bash
bash stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/scripts/install-litmus.sh
kubectl get pods -n litmus
open http://litmus.local    # login: admin / litmus
```

**Pass before §6.5.2:** **Overview** shows **Infrastructures: Active 1** (not 0, not Pending).

**Verify pods:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n litmus
# litmus-core, chaos frontend/server, mongodb, subscriber — all Running
```

#### If Overview shows 0 infrastructures or PENDING

The UI is empty until a **subscriber agent** connects your cluster:

```bash
export LITMUS_PASSWORD='litmus'   # only if you changed the default
bash stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/scripts/connect-litmus-infra.sh
```

Hard-refresh the browser. Start at **http://litmus.local** only — not old `/account/.../settings` bookmarks.

#### UI navigation (click order for §6.5.2)

1. **Overview** — confirm **Active 1**
2. **ChaosHubs** → **Pod Delete** → **Launch Experiment**
3. **Chaos Experiments** — watch **Running → Completed**

Left nav: **Overview**, **Environments**, **ChaosHub**, **Chaos Experiments**. Skip **Resilience Probes** and deep **Settings** URLs for this lab.

---

### 6.5.2 — Run your first experiment (pod delete)

**Goal:** Kill one `auth-service` pod and prove `/auth/health` stays **200**.

**Before you click Run in the UI**, open two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal A — watch pods
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -w

# Terminal B — watch health every 5 seconds
while true; do
  date +%H:%M:%S
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "health=%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/auth/health
  sleep 5
done
```

**In the UI (`http://litmus.local`):**

1. **ChaosHubs** → **Pod Delete** → **Launch Experiment**
2. Target: namespace **`clearledger`**, label **`app=auth-service`**, kind **Deployment**
3. Infrastructure: **clearledger-cluster** (must be **Active**)
4. Blast radius: **50%**, duration **30s**
5. Click **Run** (not Schedule)

**What success looks like:**

| Where | Good sign |
|-------|-----------|
| Terminal A | One pod **Terminating**, then back to **2/2 Ready** |
| Terminal B | `health=200` even while one pod is down |
| Litmus UI | Experiment **Running → Completed** |

**Prefer terminal over UI?** Skip the wizard and run [§6.5.3](#653--same-experiment-from-the-terminal-make-demo-65) (`make demo-65`) instead.

<details>
<summary>Full UI walkthrough (expand if the wizard is confusing)</summary>

**Time:** ~20 minutes. **You need:** browser at **http://litmus.local** + two terminal windows on your Mac (where `kubectl` and `/etc/hosts` for `clearledger.local` work).

> **One-line lesson:** Stage 6 (Falco) asks *“did something bad happen?”* Stage 6.5 asks *“did we stay up when a pod died?”*

#### Where you are in the UI

You are in the right place when you see:

**ChaosHubs → default hub → Chaos Experiments (10)**

That page lists experiment **cards** (Pod Delete, Pod CPU Hog, Pod Memory Hog, …). Each card is a reusable fault template.

#### ChaosHub screen — what you see

| What you see | What it means |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Pod Delete** card | Kills pod(s) matching a label — **use this one for the lab** |
| **Launch Experiment** (purple button) | Opens the wizard to target **your** app on **clearledger-cluster** |
| **Pod CPU Hog** / **Pod Memory Hog** / others | Optional follow-ups — run **one experiment at a time**, only after pod-delete succeeds |
| **Chaos Faults (53)** tab | Low-level faults; skip — use **Chaos Experiments** cards instead |
| Search box | Filter cards by name (e.g. type `pod delete`) |

#### Step 0 — Open the right page

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Go to **http://litmus.local** | Open old `/account/.../settings/projects` bookmarks (blank page) |
| Log in: `admin` + your password | Expect data before login |

**After login you should see:**

- Left nav: **Overview**, **Environments**, **ChaosHub**, **Chaos Experiments**
- **Overview** card: **Infrastructures → Active 1** (if **0**, run `connect-litmus-infra.sh` — see §6.5.1)

**What “connected” means:** A `subscriber` pod in `litmus` talks to ChaosCenter. The UI is no longer an empty shell — it can schedule experiments on **your** cluster.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n litmus | grep subscriber
# clearledger-chaos-infra-subscriber-...   1/1   Running
```

#### Step 1 — Understand the map (2 min)

```text
Litmus ChaosCenter (litmus.local)     ← you click "Run" here
        │
        ▼
subscriber / chaos-operator (litmus ns)  ← agent on YOUR cluster
        │
        ▼
auth-service pods (clearledger ns)    ← target: kill 50%, watch recovery
```

**Stage 6 (Falco)** asked: *did something suspicious happen?*
**Stage 6.5** asks: *if a pod dies, do users still get HTTP 200?*

#### Step 2 — Open terminals before you click Run (2 min)

**Terminal A — watch pods:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -w
```

**Terminal B — watch health every 5 seconds:**

```bash
while true; do
  date +%H:%M:%S
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "health=%{http_code}\n" http://clearledger.local/auth/health
  sleep 5
done
```

Leave both running. You will correlate what the UI shows with what Kubernetes actually does.

#### Step 3 — Launch pod-delete from ChaosHub (10 min)

> **Litmus UI note:** ChaosCenter labels change between versions (e.g. “Tune fault”, “Target selection”, “Chaos Experiment”). Follow the **concepts** below — match fields by meaning, not exact button text. If your wizard has extra steps (probes, hooks), accept defaults unless the lab table lists a value.

**Click path:**

1. Left nav → **ChaosHubs** (or **Chaos Hub**) → open the **default** hub
2. Tab **Chaos Experiments** — find the **Pod Delete** card (*injects random pod delete failures…*)
3. Click **Launch Experiment** (purple button on the card — may say **Create** or **Use** on older builds)

**Wizard — map each screen to these values:**

| Concept (what Litmus is asking) | Set to | UI labels you might see |
|---------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Where to run** | Infrastructure **clearledger-cluster** (**Active**, not Pending) | “Infrastructure”, “Chaos Infrastructure”, “Execution plane” |
| **Target namespace** | `clearledger` | “Namespace”, “Application namespace” |
| **Target selector** | Label `app=auth-service` | “Label”, “App label”, “Target application” |
| **Workload type** | **Deployment** | “Kind”, “Workload type”, “Resource type” |
| **Blast radius** | **50%** pods affected | “Pods affected”, “Percentage”, “PODS_AFFECTED_PERC” |
| **Duration** | **30** seconds | “Total chaos duration”, “Duration”, “Chaos interval” |
| **Fault name** | `pod-delete` (usually pre-filled from hub) | “Experiment name”, “Fault” |

**Typical wizard flow (screens may merge or reorder):**

```text
1. Select infrastructure  → clearledger-cluster (Active)
2. Target application     → namespace clearledger, label app=auth-service, kind Deployment
3. Tune fault / parameters → 50% pods, 30s duration
4. Save / Create experiment
5. Run now (not Schedule)
```

**Finish:**

1. Click **Save** / **Create** / **Finish** (whatever completes the wizard)
2. Click **Run** / **Execute** / **Start** on the experiment (not **Schedule** for this lab)
3. Left nav → **Chaos Experiments** → open your run → status **Running → Completed** (or **Succeeded**)

**Alternate path:** **Chaos Experiments** → **+ New Experiment** / **New Chaos Experiment** → search **pod-delete** → same values as the table above.

#### What to look for (UI + terminals together)

Run the terminals from **Step 2** on your Mac before you click **Run** in the UI.

| Where | Good sign | Bad sign |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Terminal A** (`kubectl … -w`) | One pod **Terminating**, then a new pod → **2/2 Ready** | 0 Running pods, or stuck CrashLoopBackOff |
| **Terminal B** (`curl …/auth/health`) | `health=200` **while** one pod is down | `502` / `503` / timeout during chaos |
| **UI — Chaos Experiments** | Status **Running** → **Completed** | Stuck **Running** forever, or Error |
| **UI — experiment timeline** | Steps/probes advance during the 30s window | Blank timeline (infra not connected) |

**Write this in your notes (DORA / resilience evidence):**

> We deleted 50% of auth-service pods; `/auth/health` stayed 200; Kubernetes recreated the pod within ~2 minutes.

#### Step 4 — Confirm recovery (3 min)

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
# exactly 2 pods, both 2/2 Ready
```

In the UI: **Environments** → **clearledger-lab** → your infrastructure → past runs should list the experiment.

#### Step 5 — What you learned (say it out loud)

1. **Replicas matter** — one dead pod ≠ outage if the Service has another healthy endpoint.
2. **Probes matter** — unhealthy pods are removed from the Service endpoints.
3. **Detection ≠ resilience** — Falco would not prove `health=200` during a pod kill; chaos did.

#### Step 6 — Optional second demo (only after Step 3 succeeds)

Wait until auth is back to **2/2 Ready**, then try **one** more card from ChaosHub:

| Card | Target | What it teaches |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Pod Memory Hog** | `notification-service` in `clearledger` | Memory pressure → OOMKill → restart |
| **Pod CPU Hog** | `auth-service` | CPU saturation under load |

Or apply the YAML equivalents (one at a time):

```bash
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/infra/chaos/notification-service-memory-hog.yaml
# wait for recovery, then:
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/infra/chaos/ledger-service-network-latency.yaml
```

</details>

---

### 6.5.3 — Same experiment from the terminal (`make demo-65`) — optional

Use this **after** the ChaosHub exercise (§6.5.2), or if you prefer a scripted demo first. It runs the **same pod-delete test** without clicking through the UI wizard.

```bash
make fix-65-prereqs    # if auth pods are not 2/2 Ready
make demo-65
```

**What the script does:**

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| Preflight | Checks Litmus is installed and 2 `auth-service` pods are Running |
| Apply | `kubectl apply -f auth-service-pod-delete.yaml` (ChaosEngine in namespace `litmus`) |
| Watch | Prints `/auth/health` every 10s for ~60s |
| Report | Shows recovery pod count + `ChaosResult` verdict |

**Expected results on the cluster:**

| Signal | Expected |
|--------|----------|
| `ChaosEngine` | `auth-service-pod-delete` in namespace `litmus` |
| `ChaosResult` | **Completed** / **Pass** |
| Auth pods after demo | **2** pods **2/2 Ready** (one was killed and replaced) |
| Events | `Killing` on old pod → `Scheduled` / `Started` on new pod |

```bash
kubectl get chaosresult -n litmus
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
```

**Pass criteria for `make demo-65`:**

| Signal | Pass? |
|--------|-------|
| Script ends with **PASS** | Required |
| `ChaosResult` **Completed / Pass** | Required |
| **2** auth pods **Running** after demo | Required |
| `health=200` on most checks | Ideal; script also passes if ChaosResult is Pass and pods recovered |

**See the run in the UI after the terminal demo:** **Chaos Experiments** (left nav) → refresh → open the latest run.

**Stage 6 netpol:** Re-apply if new auth pods stuck in `Init:0/1`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/deferred-by-stage/stage-6-runtime-security/netpol/network-policies.yaml
```

### 6.5.3a — Real output examples (verified on the lab cluster)

These samples were captured from a working cluster after `make fix-65-prereqs`, `make connect-litmus`, and `make demo-65`.

#### `make check-65`

```text
▶ Stage 6.5 — Chaos Engineering (LitmusChaos)
  ✓ litmus namespace exists
  ✓ litmus-admin ServiceAccount exists in litmus
  ✓ pod-delete ChaosExperiment installed in litmus
  ✓ Litmus chaos operator is running
  ✓ Litmus ChaosCenter reachable at http://litmus.local
  ✓ Litmus subscriber running (UI connected to cluster)
  ✓ auth-service healthy (baseline before chaos)
  ✓ auth-service has 2/2 Ready replicas (stable for chaos)
  ✓ allow-postgres NetworkPolicy exists (Stage 6 fix)

All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.
```

#### `make demo-65` — captured from a real run (2026-06-01)

```text
Stage 6.5 — auth-service pod-delete

Preflight: 2 auth-service pods Running

Applying ChaosEngine auth-service-pod-delete (namespace litmus)

Watching http://clearledger.local/auth/health

  10s  health=200  pods=2
  20s  health=200  pods=1
  30s  health=200  pods=1
  40s  health=200  pods=2
  50s  health=200  pods=2
  60s  health=200  pods=2

Result:
  ChaosResult: Completed / Pass
  Recovery:    2 auth-service pod(s) Running
  Health:      6/6 checks returned 200

PASS
```

> If health lines show `000`, run `bash scripts/setup-hosts.sh` on your Mac and re-run. The script also tries `multipass exec clearledger -- curl` when the VM is present.

#### Terminal B on your Mac (expected when hosts are correct)

```text
22:05:01
health=200
22:05:06
health=200
22:05:11
health=200
```

> Pod count may show **1** while the replacement pod is still starting — that is expected.

#### Terminal A during chaos (`kubectl get pods -w`)

```text

#### Terminal B on your Mac (manual health loop)

```text
22:05:01

#### After demo — verify

```bash
kubectl get chaosresult -n litmus
# auth-service-pod-delete-pod-delete   Completed   Pass

kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
# auth-service-84cc988c4d-xxxxx   2/2   Running
# auth-service-84cc988c4d-yyyyy   2/2   Running

kubectl get cm subscriber-config -n litmus -o jsonpath='{.data.IS_INFRA_CONFIRMED}'
# true
```

#### Subscriber connected (infrastructure Active in UI)

```text
kubectl logs -n litmus -l app.kubernetes.io/name=subscriber --tail=3
level=info msg="AgentID: a63c2a2c-... has been confirmed"
level=info msg="Server connection established, Listening...."
```

---

### 6.5.4 — Understand the YAML files (read before running)

Each file is a **`ChaosEngine`** — a request to Litmus: “run experiment X against app Y for Z seconds.”

#### `litmus-install.yaml`

Creates the `litmus` namespace only. Platform workloads live here, separate from `clearledger` app pods.

#### `litmus-rbac.yaml`

| Resource | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ServiceAccount litmus-admin` (namespace `litmus`) | Identity for Litmus runner pods |
| `ClusterRoleBinding → cluster-admin` | Allows deleting pods / injecting faults in `clearledger` (lab simplification; production would use least-privilege) |

#### `auth-service-pod-delete.yaml` (Experiment 1 — used by demo)

```yaml
metadata:
  namespace: litmus          # engine lives here (Kyverno-safe)
spec:
  appinfo:
    appns: clearledger       # target app namespace
    applabel: app=auth-service
    appkind: deployment
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            - name: PODS_AFFECTED_PERC
              value: "50"    # 50% of 2 replicas = 1 pod killed
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "30"    # chaos window in seconds
```

**What happens when applied:**

1. Operator reads `ChaosEngine` → creates `auth-service-pod-delete-runner` pod in `litmus`
2. Runner selects one `auth-service` pod in `clearledger` → sends SIGTERM / delete
3. Kubernetes Deployment controller sees 1/2 replicas → schedules a replacement pod
4. Service routes traffic to the **surviving** replica during recovery
5. `ChaosResult` CR records pass/fail from Litmus’s perspective

#### `ledger-service-network-latency.yaml` (Experiment 2 — manual)

Adds **2000 ms** network latency to `ledger-service` pods for 60 seconds. Proves timeouts return **503** instead of hanging the UI.

#### `notification-service-memory-hog.yaml` (Experiment 3 — manual)

Fills **80%** of pod memory limit for 60 seconds. Proves OOMKill + restart behavior.

> **Never apply all three at once.** Run one experiment, verify recovery, then the next.

---

### 6.5.5 — After the demo — what to look for (do not skip)

**1. During chaos — availability**

| Signal | Good | Bad |
|---|---|---|
| `curl http://clearledger.local/auth/health` | **200** while one pod is down | 502/503/timeout |
| `kubectl get pods -l app=auth-service` | 1 Running + 1 Init/Pending (replacement starting) | 0 Running |

**Why 200 is enough:** The Kubernetes **Service** load-balances to healthy endpoints. One replica dying should not kill the Service if the other passes readiness probes.

**2. After chaos — recovery**

| Signal | Good | Bad |
|---|---|---|
| Pod count | 2/2 **Ready** (may take 1–2 min — Vault agent init) | Stuck at 1 replica |
| Events | `Killing` then `Scheduled` / `Started` on new pod | Repeated CrashLoopBackOff |
| ArgoCD | Synced (if you deleted a pod, Deployment controller heals — GitOps desired state unchanged) | — |

**3. Litmus `ChaosResult` verdict**

```bash
kubectl get chaosresult -n litmus
```

Verdict may show **Error** if Litmus targets a pod still in `Init:0/1` (Vault agent starting). That is a Litmus timing issue, not necessarily failed resilience.

**Your pass criteria for this lab:**

- `/auth/health` returned **200** at least once during the chaos window
- A pod was **Killed** (see events)
- Deployment returned to **2 replicas**

**4. Falco during chaos**

Falco may or may not alert on pod delete — that is normal. Pod deletion by the kubelet/Litmus is not the same as an attacker shell. No ClearLedger Critical alerts is **expected**.

**Optional second terminal during demo:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service -w
```

Watch one pod terminate and a new one appear — that is Kubernetes self-healing in real time.

---

### 6.5.6 — Manual experiments (after Experiment 1 succeeds)

Wait until both auth-service pods show **2/2 Ready**, then run **one** experiment at a time:

```bash
# Experiment 2 — 2s network latency on ledger-service (60s)
kubectl delete chaosengine ledger-service-network-latency -n litmus --ignore-not-found
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/infra/chaos/ledger-service-network-latency.yaml

# Experiment 3 — memory pressure on notification-service (60s)
kubectl delete chaosengine notification-service-memory-hog -n litmus --ignore-not-found
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/infra/chaos/notification-service-memory-hog.yaml
```

| Experiment | File | What to verify |
|---|---|---|
| Pod delete | `auth-service-pod-delete.yaml` | Health 200 during kill; 2 replicas after |
| Network latency | `ledger-service-network-latency.yaml` | API returns 503/timeout, not infinite hang |
| Memory hog | `notification-service-memory-hog.yaml` | Pod OOMKills and restarts; Redis subscription recovers |

Clean up an experiment:

```bash
kubectl delete chaosengine auth-service-pod-delete -n litmus
```

---

### 6.5.7 — Health check

```bash
make check-65
```

**Expected:** see full sample in [§6.5.3a](#653a--real-output-examples-verified-on-the-lab-cluster) (`make check-65` block). Minimum:

```text
▶ Stage 6.5 — Chaos Engineering (LitmusChaos)
  ✓ Litmus subscriber running (UI connected to cluster)
  ✓ auth-service has 2/2 Ready replicas (stable for chaos)
  ...
All checks passed. Ready for the next stage.
```

---

### Stage 6.5 complete — done checklist

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Litmus operator running | `kubectl get pods -n litmus` — `litmus-*` Running |
| 2 | Experiments installed | `kubectl get chaosexperiment pod-delete -n litmus` |
| 3 | Pod-delete demo run | `make demo-65` — health 200 during chaos |
| 4 | Recovery observed | 2 auth-service replicas Ready; Killing/Scheduled events |
| 5 | Evidence saved | Terminal output from `run-chaos.sh` (DORA artifact) |
| 6 | Health check | `make check-65` green |
| 7 | UI infrastructure connected | Overview → **Active: 1** (§6.5.2) |

### What you learned in Stage 6.5

- **Detection ≠ resilience** — Falco alerts do not prove HA
- **Replicas + Services + probes** — why `replicas: 2` is not cosmetic
- **ChaosEngine YAML** — declarative failure injection as code
- **Platform vs app namespaces** — Kyverno blocks chaos runners in `clearledger`; engines run in `litmus`
- **MTTR** — time from pod kill to 2/2 Ready again (Stage 7 graphs this)

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Ran chaos experiments with LitmusChaos (pod-delete, network latency, memory pressure) to prove the system recovers, and can distinguish detection from resilience.

### DevSecOps lesson — Stage 6.5

Security tooling tells you when something looks wrong. **Resilience testing** tells you whether the business keeps running anyway. Together they match what production teams and DORA expect: detect incidents *and* prove you tested recovery before auditors ask.

**Save your VM before Stage 7** (optional stage — skip if you did not run 6.5). After `make check-65` passes:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=65
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage65 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: `make snapshots` → `make restore STAGE=65`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 7 — Security Observability

> Security you cannot measure you cannot prove.

**Goal:** Understand how **metrics**, **logs**, and **dashboards** fit together — then prove it by running commands in the terminal, watching the same events appear in Grafana, and explaining what each panel means.

This stage is **not** “install Grafana and move on.” **Stage 7 is not complete** until your dashboards show **real** Kyverno violations and Falco alerts that **you triggered** in §7.4 — plus portfolio screenshots (§7.6). `make check-7` only proves the stack is up; it does **not** prove you can detect security events.

**Before you start:** `make check-6` should pass (Stage 6.5 is optional — skip is fine). Check the VM is not overloaded: `multipass exec clearledger -- uptime`. If you ran Stage 6.5, do [§7.0](#70--free-node-resources-scale-down-litmus) first to scale Litmus down. Plan about half a day — this is the heaviest stage on a single-node VM.

**Done when:** §7.6 is complete — dashboards show **your** Kyverno denial and Falco alert, not empty panels. Then `make check-7` (§7.7), `make snapshot STAGE=7`, and `make snapshots` (confirm `clearledger.stage7`).

**Already installed?** If `kubectl get pods -n monitoring` shows Grafana **3/3** and Loki **1/1**, skip §7.1. Start at §7.2 (verify the stack), then §7.4 (hands-on lab).

---

### What you need to know first

Up to now, each stage had its own window into the cluster. Stage 3 gave you CI scan results in GitHub Actions. Stage 4 showed Kyverno blocking a bad deploy in the terminal. Stage 6 gave you Falco alerts in its UI, and you could always run `kubectl logs` on a pod. Those views are useful, but they are scattered.

Stage 7 brings them together in one place: **Grafana**. Instead of jumping between five different tools, you open a dashboard and see whether security events, policy violations, and app health are happening over time.

#### The three tools you are installing

**Prometheus** collects numbers from the cluster — things like “how many Kyverno denials in the last hour” or “how many HTTP requests per second.” It checks those numbers every 15–30 seconds and keeps a history you can graph.

**Loki** collects log lines — the same kind of text you see from `kubectl logs`, but from many pods at once. Falco alerts, failed login attempts, and application errors all land here so you can search them later.

**Grafana** is the web UI where charts and tables pull data from Prometheus and Loki. This is what you would show an auditor: not a one-off terminal screenshot, but proof that you can **find and measure** events after they happen.

Prometheus does not magically know what to collect. **ServiceMonitors** and **PodMonitors** are small config objects that point it at the right targets. If Kyverno has no monitor, the Kyverno dashboard stays empty even when Kyverno is working fine. The same applies to application request rates — those panels stay blank until §7.5, when metrics-enabled images are deployed through GitOps.

Logs follow a similar path. **Promtail** reads container logs and sends them to Loki. If Loki is not running, Grafana log panels show “No data” even though `kubectl logs` still works on individual pods.

#### How this connects to what you already built

When you blocked a bad `kubectl apply` in Stage 4, Kyverno recorded that denial. In Stage 7, that shows up on the **Kyverno Policy Violations** dashboard (via Prometheus).

When you triggered a shell inside a pod in Stage 6, Falco wrote an alert. In Stage 7, that appears on the **Security Event Timeline** (via Loki).

When ClearLedger handles HTTP traffic or a failed login, those events feed the **Service Health** dashboards (Loki and Prometheus together).

Vault (Stage 5) and network policies (Stage 6) do not always have their own flashy panel, but they still matter: fewer secrets in Git and blocked pod traffic show up indirectly in a healthier, quieter cluster.

#### What you will do in this stage

You will run a command in the terminal — for example, a Kyverno violation or a Falco trigger — and then wait a short time while Prometheus or Loki ingests the event. Within about 15–90 seconds, the matching Grafana panel should update.

That is the whole point of observability for security: the terminal proves the event happened once; the dashboard proves you can **detect and measure** it later, without being logged into the cluster at that exact moment.

---

### 7.0 — Free node resources (scale down Litmus)

Stage 6.5 is complete — you do not need the Litmus UI, MongoDB, or chaos operator running while Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana start. They compete for the same CPUs on a single-node lab VM (6 by default; see `scripts/setup-cluster.sh`). Scaling Litmus to zero frees ~500–800MB RAM and reduces CPU churn before the observability install.

```bash
kubectl scale deployment,statefulset -n litmus --replicas=0 --all
kubectl get pods -n litmus
# Expected: no Running pods (Succeeded job pods from chaos experiments are OK)
multipass exec clearledger -- uptime
# Expected: load average (1m) ideally below ~8 before continuing
```

You can scale Litmus back up later if you want to re-run chaos experiments (`bash stages/stage-6.5-chaos-engineering/scripts/install-litmus.sh`). For Stages 7–7.5, keep it scaled down.

---

### 7.1 — Install the observability stack

**Safe to run more than once.** The script checks what is already installed. If Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki are healthy, it skips the heavy install and only updates dashboards and scrape configs. Running it again after a partial failure will not duplicate or break a working stack.

**When to add `FORCE=1`:** only if something is genuinely stuck — for example you edited the Helm values files and need a full reinstall, or Loki keeps crashing in a restart loop:

```bash
FORCE=1 bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/install-observability.sh
```

On a first-time install, use the plain command in Step 1 below. Do not use `FORCE=1` unless the troubleshooting section tells you to.

**macOS, Linux, and WSL2:** `FORCE=1 bash ...` works as written. **Native Windows PowerShell** does not use that syntax — run the lab inside **WSL2 Ubuntu** (recommended), or set the variable first: `$env:FORCE=1; bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/install-observability.sh`.

**Step 1 — install** (wait until the script prints `✓ Stage 7 installed.`):

```bash
bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/install-observability.sh
```

#### While Step 1 runs — you may see “Waiting for Falco” near the end

Most of the install is about Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki. Then the terminal suddenly mentions Falco again. If you finished Stage 6 a while ago, that can feel out of place.

**What you already have from Stage 6:** Falco watches running pods and writes alerts when something suspicious happens — like a shell starting inside `auth-service`. You proved that worked at `http://falco.local` or with `kubectl logs`.

**What Stage 7 adds:** Grafana cannot open the Falco UI. Stage 7 builds a path so the **same alerts** also show up on a Grafana dashboard called **Security Event Timeline**. Think of it as plumbing:

1. Falco still runs in the `falco` namespace (same as Stage 6).
2. **Promtail** (installed with Loki) copies Falco’s log lines into **Loki**.
3. Grafana reads those lines from Loki and draws the timeline chart.

The install script touches Falco one more time to make sure that plumbing can connect. It re-runs the **same Stage 6 Helm chart** — an upgrade, not a second Falco. You might see `Waiting for Falco DaemonSet` for a few minutes. **Let it finish.** That message is expected.

Empty Grafana panels right after install are also normal — you have not triggered any new alerts yet. In **§7.4** you run a shell inside a pod again (same idea as Stage 6) and watch the alert land on the **Security Event Timeline** in Grafana, not only in the Falco UI.

**Step 2 — check pods** (run this after Step 1 finishes):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

You want something like this (pod name suffixes vary):

```text
NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-prometheus-stack-grafana-....                3/3     Running   0          5m
kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-....             2/2     Running   0          5m
loki-0                                            1/1     Running   0          5m
loki-promtail-....                                1/1     Running   0          5m
```

Grafana must show **3/3** Ready (not 2/3). Loki must show **1/1**. If pods are still `Pending` or `ContainerCreating`, wait a few minutes and run `kubectl get pods -n monitoring` again.

**Expected — Loki healthy:**

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring loki-0 -- wget -qO- http://127.0.0.1:3100/ready
```

```text
ready
```

**Expected — Grafana can reach Loki (same path log panels use):**

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring deploy/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -c grafana -- \
  wget -qO- --timeout=5 http://loki:3100/ready
```

```text
ready
```

**Expected — Grafana UI reachable:**

```bash
curl -sI http://grafana.local | head -n 1
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
```

Log in: **http://grafana.local** — `admin` / `admin123`

> Empty panels right after install are **normal**. You have not generated events yet. Continue to §7.2–§7.4.

If Helm fails: wait 30s, then `FORCE=1 bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/install-observability.sh`. See [troubleshooting.md — Stage 7](troubleshooting.md#stage-7--observability-grafana--prometheus--loki).

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — the whole stack is healthy, especially Loki**

This is where single-node runs die: Loki crash-loops and the dashboard ConfigMaps never land, but Grafana looks fine — so you waste an hour on "empty dashboards."

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl get pods -n monitoring -l app.kubernetes.io/name=loki \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.containerStatuses[*].restartCount}{"\n"}'
kubectl get configmap -n monitoring -l clearledger_dashboard=1 --no-headers | wc -l
```

Expected: all monitoring pods `Running`; Loki restart count `0` (or low and **stable**, not climbing); the ConfigMap count is `6` — your six dashboards. If Loki restarts keep climbing or the count is `0`, stop here — opening Grafana now only shows empty panels.

If you skip this, you spend the rest of Stage 7 debugging "why are my dashboards empty" when the real failure was Loki crash-looping at install.

---

### 7.2 — Verify Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana (before opening dashboards)

Run these three checks so you know **which layer** is broken if a panel is empty.

#### Check 1 — Prometheus has Kyverno metrics

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring deploy/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -c grafana -- \
  wget -qO- 'http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring:9090/api/v1/query?query=kyverno_admission_requests_total' 2>/dev/null \
  | head -c 400
```

(Prometheus runs as a StatefulSet pod, not a Deployment — this query goes through Grafana to the Prometheus Service.)

**Expected:** JSON with `"status":"success"` and a `"metric"` block (values may be `0` until you trigger a violation in §7.4).

If you see `"status":"success"` but `"result":[]`, Prometheus is up but Kyverno has not recorded admissions yet — that is fine before the lab.

#### Check 2 — Loki has Falco logs

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring loki-0 -- wget -qO- \
  'http://127.0.0.1:3100/loki/api/v1/labels' 2>/dev/null | head -c 300
```

**Expected:** JSON listing labels such as `"namespace"` (and after Falco events, you will see `"falco"` in label values).

Quick log search (may return empty lines until §7.4 Exercise B):

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring loki-0 -- wget -qO- \
  'http://127.0.0.1:3100/loki/api/v1/query?query=%7Bnamespace%3D%22falco%22%7D&limit=3' 2>/dev/null \
  | head -c 500
```

**Expected:** `"status":"success"` — `"result":[]` means no Falco lines in Loki yet, not a broken Loki.

#### Check 3 — Grafana imported ClearLedger dashboards

```bash
curl -s -u admin:admin123 'http://grafana.local/api/search?tag=clearledger' | jq -r '.[].title'
```

**Expected — six titles:**

```text
ClearLedger - Compliance Posture
ClearLedger - DORA Metrics
ClearLedger - Kubernetes Audit Log Analysis
ClearLedger - Kyverno Policy Violations
ClearLedger - Security Event Timeline
ClearLedger - Service Health + Auth Security
```

Or in the UI: **Dashboards** → filter tag **`clearledger`** → you should see exactly these six (no missing names).

---

### 7.3 — Your first 10 minutes in Grafana

**What you are doing here:** logging in and clicking around so Grafana feels familiar. You are **not** proving anything yet — that is **§7.4**. Right now empty panels and zeros are normal.

#### Step 1 — open Grafana

Go to **http://grafana.local** and log in: `admin` / `admin123`.

#### Step 2 — set the time range

Top-right corner → click the time picker → choose **Last 15 minutes**. Do this on every dashboard while learning. If the range is too wide (Last 24 hours), Loki queries can slow down on a small VM.

#### Step 3 — open dashboards one at a time

Open **one** link, look around, then close it or move to the next. Do not open all six in separate tabs at once — Loki can struggle on a single-node lab VM.

1. [Kyverno Policy Violations](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-kyverno-violations) — policy blocks from Stage 4. You may see zeros. That is fine before §7.4.
2. [Security Event Timeline](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-security-events) — Falco alerts from Stage 6. You may see old `postgres` noise or an empty log table. Also fine before §7.4.
3. [Service Health + Auth](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-service-health) — app traffic and login attempts.
4. [Compliance Posture](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-compliance) — summary view for auditors. Skim it; come back after §7.4.
5. [Audit Log Analysis](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-audit-logs) — often empty on MicroK8s. That is expected; not a bug.
6. [DORA Metrics](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-dora-metrics) — deploy-frequency style charts. Optional skim.

Use the links above (short URLs). Avoid old bookmarked URLs with long random slugs — they can show `not correct url` in the browser.

**Alternative:** **Dashboards** (left menu) → search tag **`clearledger`** → you should see the same six titles from Check 3 in §7.2.

#### Step 4 — how to read what you see (quick)

Grafana panels pull data from two places:

- **Prometheus** — numbers over time (Kyverno violation counts, request rates).
- **Loki** — log lines (Falco JSON alerts, auth-service log messages).

A **big number** panel asks: did this count go above zero? A **line chart** asks: was there a spike after I ran something? A **logs** panel shows the actual text — rule names, `CRITICAL`, `Failed login attempt`.

If **only** log panels say `connection refused`, Loki may be down — re-check §7.1. If number panels work but log panels fail, that points to Loki specifically.

#### What you should expect right now (before §7.4)

You are only touring the UI. Empty or zero panels do **not** mean Stage 7 failed.

- **Kyverno** — violations at 0 or flat lines. Normal until you trigger a bad `kubectl apply` in §7.4.
- **Security Event Timeline** — empty table, or old Falco noise from `postgres`. Normal until you trigger a shell in §7.4.
- **Service Health** — failed logins at 0. Normal until §7.4.
- **Compliance** — top stats at zero. Normal until §7.4.

After §7.4, those same dashboards should show **your** events: a Kyverno denial, a Falco CRITICAL shell alert, and failed login counts above zero.

#### Step 5 — move on

When you have opened at least dashboards **1–3** and you understand that empty panels are OK for now, continue to **§7.4**. That is where you run commands in the terminal and watch the panels update.

---

### 7.4 — Hands-on lab: terminal → dashboard proof

This is the core learning section. Each exercise: run the command, wait, then confirm in Grafana.

**Timing:** wait **30–90 seconds** after each command for Prometheus scrape and Loki ingestion.

> **Prefer a guided script?** The same steps run interactively with pauses:
> `bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/generate-dashboard-data.sh`

---

#### Exercise A — Kyverno block → Prometheus → Kyverno dashboard

**Terminal** — apply a pod that violates Stage 4 policy (runs as root):

```bash
cat <<'YAML' | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: stage7-kyverno-lab
  namespace: clearledger
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: nginx:alpine
YAML
```

**How to know it worked**

You are testing whether Kyverno **blocks** a deliberately bad pod. Success means the pod **never gets created**.

**Pass — you should see:**

- The terminal prints **`Error from server`** and **`denied the request`**
- The exact policy names in the error do not matter. Your output might list one rule or several (`disallow-root-containers`, `require-resource-limits`, `drop-all-capabilities`, …). More lines just means more rules failed — that is still a pass.
- The pod name never shows up in the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger | grep stage7-kyverno-lab
```

**Expected:** no output.

**Fail — stop and fix Stage 4 first:**

- The command ends quietly with **`created`** (no error)
- `kubectl get pods -n clearledger` shows **`stage7-kyverno-lab`**

That means Kyverno let a root pod through. Run `make check-4` before continuing Stage 7.

**Example of a passing terminal** (yours may list more policies):

```text
Error from server: error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "validate.kyverno.svc" denied the request:
policy disallow-root-containers/validate-run-as-non-root fail: Running as root is not allowed
```

**Confirm Prometheus saw it** (optional but useful if Grafana is empty):

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring deploy/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -c grafana -- \
  wget -qO- 'http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring:9090/api/v1/query?query=kyverno_admission_requests_total{request_allowed="false"}' 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -o '"value":\[[^]]*\]' | head -3
```

**Expected:** a `"value"` entry with a recent Unix timestamp and a number **greater than 0** (for example `"value":[..., "1"]`). If you see this, Kyverno and Prometheus are working even when Grafana panels say **No data**.

**Grafana** — open [Kyverno Policy Violations](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-kyverno-violations?from=now-15m&to=now). Set time range **Last 15 minutes** (top-right).

**Which panels to check** (titles match the dashboard exactly):

- **Top row:** **Policy Violations (time range)** and **Violations (time range)** — both should show a number **> 0**. **Active Kyverno Rules** (often **18**) proves Grafana can reach Prometheus even when the other two are empty.
- **Middle:** **Violation Rate by Resource Kind** — a spike for **Pod** near the time you ran the command.
- **Bottom:** **Top Blocked Resource Types** — a row for **Pod**; **Violations by Namespace (trend)** — a spike for **clearledger**.

**If the top two stat panels say "No data" but Prometheus shows a value > 0**

This is a common timing quirk, not a broken install. Those panels use `increase()` over the selected time range. Prometheus needs to see the counter **change** during the window (for example 1 → 2). A single denial can record in Prometheus while Grafana still shows **No data**.

Do this:

1. Run the same `kubectl apply` command **a second time** (it will be denied again — that is expected).
2. Wait **60 seconds** (Prometheus scrapes every ~30s).
3. In Grafana: **Last 15 minutes** → click **Refresh** (circular arrow, top-right).

After the second denial you should see **2** in the top stat panels and spikes on the Pod / clearledger charts. Screenshot that for §7.6.

**Still empty? Prove it in Explore** (counts for the lab):

1. Grafana left menu → **Explore**
2. Datasource: **Prometheus**
3. Query: `sum(kyverno_admission_requests_total{request_allowed="false"})`
4. **Run query** — expect **1** or **2**

A screenshot of the terminal denial plus Explore showing a number **> 0** is enough portfolio proof if the dashboard stats stay slow.

---

#### Exercise B — Falco shell → Loki → Security Event Timeline

**What you are doing (same idea as Exercise A):**

- **Exercise A:** you did something bad → Kyverno blocked it → Grafana **Kyverno** dashboard updated.
- **Exercise B:** you do something suspicious **inside** a running pod → Falco detects it → Grafana **Security Event Timeline** updates.

You already did this in **Stage 6** (`make demo-6`). Here you do it again and prove the alert shows up in **Grafana**, not only in `http://falco.local`.

**The story in one line:** pretend you are an attacker who got shell access inside `auth-service` — Falco should scream, and the scream should appear on the timeline dashboard.

---

**Step 1 — trigger the alert (terminal)**

Copy-paste all three lines:

```bash
AUTH_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l app=auth-service \
  --field-selector=status.phase=Running -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo "Using pod: $AUTH_POD"
kubectl exec -n clearledger "$AUTH_POD" -c auth-service -- /bin/sh -c 'id && exit'
```

**You only need to read two lines of output. Ignore everything else.**

```text
Using pod: auth-service-77b7d9cd99-xxxxx     ← real pod name (not empty)
uid=1000 gid=1000 groups=1000                 ← command ran inside the pod
```

That is Step 1 done. The pod is still running — you did not break anything.

**Fail:** `error: Internal error` or `container not found` — run `kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service` and retry with a **Running** pod.

---

**Step 2 — confirm Falco saw it (terminal, right away)**

The Falco log is one long JSON line. Do not try to read the whole thing. Run:

```bash
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco --tail=50 | grep -i 'Shell spawned'
```

**Pass — you should see one short phrase somewhere in the line:**

```text
Shell spawned in ClearLedger container ... pod=auth-service-... cmd=sh -c id && exit
```

Or the rule name:

```text
"rule":"Shell Spawned in ClearLedger Container"
```

**That one grep hit means Exercise B worked in the terminal.** Screenshot this line for your portfolio.

**Ignore:**

- `Defaulted container "falco" out of: ...` — normal kubectl noise
- Lines about `postgres-0` and `/etc/passwd` — background noise from Stage 6, not your test
- The rest of the JSON (`output_fields`, `k8smeta`, etc.) — you do not need to parse it

**If grep prints nothing:** run Step 1 again, wait 5 seconds, then re-run the grep.

---

**Step 3 — confirm Loki stored it (wait ~60 seconds first)**

Promtail needs a moment to ship the log line to Loki. Wait **60–90 seconds** after Step 1, then:

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring loki-0 -- wget -qO- \
  'http://127.0.0.1:3100/loki/api/v1/query?query=%7Bnamespace%3D%22falco%22%2Ccontainer%3D%22falco%22%7D%20%7C%3D%20%22Shell%20spawned%22&limit=3' 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -i 'auth-service'
```

**Pass:** a line mentioning **`auth-service`** and **Shell spawned**.

**Do not use** `grep ClearLedger` alone — postgres noise also contains the word `ClearLedger` and will fool you into thinking Loki has your shell alert when it does not.

**Empty output?** As long as Step 2 passed, continue to Step 4 — Grafana may still show CRITICAL counts from Falco traffic even when this grep is empty.

---

**Step 4 — open Grafana (most panels empty is normal)**

Open [Security Event Timeline](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-security-events?from=now-1h&to=now).

Before you look at panels:

1. Time range → **Last 1 hour**
2. Auto-refresh → **Off** (not 5s)
3. Run Step 1 **again** if your shell was more than a few minutes ago
4. Wait **90 seconds**, then click **Refresh** once

**What you will see — and what it means**

| Panel | Common result | Good enough for the lab? |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **CRITICAL Alerts (period)** | Big number (e.g. **836**) | **Yes** — Falco → Loki → Grafana is working |
| **Recent CRITICAL / WARNING Events** | Many rows saying `Sensitive file read` / `postgres-0` | **Partial** — Falco logs are flowing; scroll or search for **`auth-service`** or **Shell spawned** |
| **Falco Alerts by Priority** (top chart) | **No data** | **OK to ignore** — heavy query often times out on a small VM |
| **Alerts by Rule Name** | **No data** | **OK to ignore** |
| **WARNING / Total Events** | **No data** | **OK to ignore** |

**You are not failing if only the bottom-left red stat and the log list have data.** Postgres noise drowns out your single shell line in the log panel — that is expected on this cluster.

**Pass for Exercise B (pick one):**

1. **Best:** Step 2 grep shows `Shell spawned` **and** Grafana **CRITICAL Alerts** ≥ 1 — screenshot both
2. **Also fine:** Step 2 grep screenshot **plus** Grafana log panel showing any CRITICAL rows (proves Loki path works even if shell is buried)
3. **Fallback:** Step 2 grep **plus** Grafana **Explore** → Loki → `{namespace="falco", container="falco"} |= "Shell spawned"`

**To find your shell in the log panel:** click inside **Recent CRITICAL / WARNING Events** and use the browser search (Cmd+F) for `auth-service` or `Shell spawned`.

Screenshot for §7.6.

---

#### Exercise C — Failed login → Loki → Service Health

**What you are doing:** pretend someone is guessing passwords on your login API. `auth-service` writes `Failed login attempt` to its logs. Grafana **Service Health** should show the count go up.

Same pattern as A and B: **terminal action → logs → dashboard**.

---

**Step 1 — send bad login attempts (terminal)**

Copy-paste the whole block:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do
  curl -s http://clearledger.local/auth/health >/dev/null
  curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/login \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"email":"lab-attacker@evil.com","password":"wrong"}' >/dev/null
done
echo "done"
```

**Pass:** the only output you need is:

```text
done
```

No output from the `curl` lines is normal. The loop hits `/auth/health` (keeps the app warm) and `/auth/login` with a wrong password ten times.

**Fail:** `curl: (6) Could not resolve host` — run `bash scripts/setup-hosts.sh` on your Mac. `curl: (7) Failed to connect` — check `kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service`.

---

**Step 2 — confirm auth-service logged it (terminal, right away)**

```bash
kubectl logs -n clearledger -l app=auth-service --tail=30 | grep -i 'Failed login' | tail -3
```

**Pass — you should see lines like:**

```text
Failed login attempt for email: lab-attacker@evil.com
```

You may see several lines (one per failed attempt). **One line is enough.** Screenshot this for your portfolio.

**If grep prints nothing:** wait 10 seconds and run again. If still empty, check the auth pod is Running: `kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service`.

---

**Step 3 — open Grafana (wait ~60 seconds after Step 1)**

Open [Service Health + Auth Security](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-service-health?from=now-1h&to=now).

Set **Last 1 hour**, auto-refresh **Off**, click **Refresh** once.

**What to check (ignore empty panels elsewhere):**

| Panel | Pass | If empty |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Failed Login Attempts** | Number **> 0** | Step 2 passed? Wait 60s, refresh. Terminal proof still counts. |
| **Auth Service Logs** | Lines with `Failed login attempt` | Use Cmd+F in the panel for `lab-attacker` |
| **Successful Logins** | May stay **0** | Fine — you only sent bad passwords |
| **Request Rate** | May be empty | Fine until §7.5 metrics images — not required for Exercise C |

**Pass for Exercise C:** Step 2 grep **plus** **Failed Login Attempts** > 0 **or** log panel showing your email.

---

#### Exercise D — Compliance dashboard (the auditor summary)

**What you are doing:** open one dashboard that rolls up Exercises A, B, and C. This is the “show the auditor” view — admission control + runtime detection + application security in one screen.

**When:** only after you finished A, B, and C.

**Step 1 — open the dashboard**

[Compliance Posture](http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-compliance?from=now-1h&to=now)

Set **Last 1 hour**, auto-refresh **Off**, click **Refresh**.

**Step 2 — check the top row stats**

| Stat on dashboard | Came from | Pass |
|-------------------|-----------|------|
| **Policy Violations** | Exercise A (Kyverno) | **> 0** |
| **Runtime Threats** | Exercise B (Falco) | **> 0** (postgres noise counts — that is OK) |
| **Failed Auth Attempts** | Exercise C (bad logins) | **> 0** |

All three do not need to be huge numbers. They just need to be **above zero** after your tests.

**If one stat is still 0:** re-run that exercise (A, B, or C), wait 90 seconds, refresh. Policy Violations may need a second Kyverno denial like Exercise A.

**This is screenshot #3 for §7.6** — the single frame that proves defense-in-depth.

---

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — you proved detection, not just installation**

Quick sanity check that Grafana is wired up:

```bash
curl -s -u admin:admin123 'http://grafana.local/api/search?tag=clearledger' | jq -r '.[].title'
curl -s -u admin:admin123 'http://grafana.local/api/datasources' | jq -r '.[].name'
```

**Pass:** six dashboard titles (Kyverno, Security Event Timeline, Service Health, Compliance, Audit Log, DORA) and datasources **Prometheus** + **Loki**.

**Stage 7 is about detection.** `make check-7` only proves pods are running. You are done when **you** triggered events in §7.4 and saved screenshots per **§7.6** — Kyverno denial, Falco alert, failed logins, and the Compliance summary.

---

### 7.5 — Optional: Prometheus metrics for Request Rate

Log panels work without image changes. **Request Rate** needs app images that expose `/metrics`.

The `/metrics` endpoint is already in the app source (`app/*/prom_metrics.py`) and is included in every CI build. If your cluster still runs **old image tags** from before that code landed, Prometheus has nothing to scrape.

**Preferred — GitOps (same path as Stage 1–2):**

```bash
git push origin main
# CI builds signed images → updates clearledger-infra → ArgoCD syncs
# Wait for ArgoCD Synced + Healthy, then verify (~60s after rollout):
```

> Skip this section if `http_requests_total` already returns data in Prometheus.

**Lab shortcut only** — bypasses Git; ArgoCD `selfHeal` may revert within ~3 minutes unless you update `clearledger-infra` or temporarily disable self-heal (see §2 rollback):

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-user
bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/build-metrics-images.sh
```

**Expected — query after rollout (~60s):**

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring deploy/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -c grafana -- \
  wget -qO- 'http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring:9090/api/v1/query?query=http_requests_total' 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -o '"__name__":"http_requests_total"' | head -1
```

```text
"__name__":"http_requests_total"
```

Then refresh **Service Health** — **Request Rate** lines should appear.

---

### 7.6 — Stage 7 complete checklist + screenshots

#### Done vs not done

| Status | What you have |
|---|---|
| **Not done** | Grafana opens, six dashboards listed, panels empty or only old noise |
| **Not done** | `make check-7` passes but you never ran §7.4 |
| **Done** | You ran §7.4 (or `make demo-7`), waited 30–90s, panels show **your** events, three screenshots saved |

#### Portfolio screenshots (required)

Set time range to **Last 15 minutes** before each capture. Include the Grafana time picker and panel titles in the frame.

| # | Open this URL | Exact panel(s) that must be visible | What the screenshot must show |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-security-events | **Recent CRITICAL / WARNING Events** (log panel) | At least one row with **CRITICAL** and text like `Terminal shell in container` (from Exercise B) |
| **2** | http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-kyverno-violations | **Violations (last hour)** (big stat, top row) | Number **≥ 1** (red background). Optional: **Violation Rate** chart ticked up in last 15m |
| **3** | http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-compliance | Top row stats | **Policy Violations**, **Runtime Threats**, and **Failed Auth Attempts** all **> 0** after Exercises A–C |
| **4 (optional)** | http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-service-health | **Failed Login Attempts** | Stat **> 0** and/or **Auth Service Logs** with `Failed login attempt` lines |

**Where to save files:** e.g. `docs/evidence/stage-7-screenshot-1-falco.png` (or your portfolio folder). Filename should say what proof it is.

**Stage 7 is done when:** `make check-7` passes **and** screenshots **1–3** show events from **your** §7.4 run — not from a demo video or someone else’s cluster.

---

### 7.7 — Verify

```bash
make check-7
```

**Expected:**

```text
▶ Stage 7 — Observability (Grafana + Prometheus + Loki)
  ✓ Prometheus is running
  ✓ Grafana reachable (http://grafana.local or in-cluster health OK)
  ✓ Loki pod is running (0 restarts)
  ✓ Loki reachable from Grafana (http://loki:3100/ready)
  ✓ ClearLedger alerting rules exist
  ✓ ClearLedger dashboards imported (6 found)
```

Warnings about Loki restarts or missing dashboards — fix with §7.1 before claiming Stage 7 complete. **Save your VM** after §7.6 and `make check-7` — see the block at the end of Stage 7 below.

---

### 7.8 — What broke (lab notes + interview talking points)

**The stack in one sentence:** Prometheus stores **numbers** (metrics), Loki stores **log lines**, Grafana **displays** both. Nothing appears until something actually happens in the cluster.

#### What tripped you up in the lab

1. **Empty dashboards right after install**
   Normal. Grafana does not create events — you trigger them in §7.4 (Kyverno denial, Falco shell, failed logins).

2. **Loki slow or refresh stuck on “Cancel”**
   Falco logs are huge. **Last 24 hours** overloads a small cluster. Use **Last 1 hour**, one dashboard at a time, wait ~10 seconds.

3. **`make check-7` passed but panels still empty** *(lab checklist only — not an interview topic)*
   The health check confirms Prometheus/Loki/Grafana pods are up. It does **not** mean events exist. You still need §7.4 + §7.6 before you snapshot and move on.

#### What to say in interviews (two real topics)

| Topic | One-liner |
|---|---|
| Empty dashboards | “Grafana is a viewer — panels stay empty until the underlying metric or log exists in the time range.” |
| Loki overload / slow queries | “We hit query storms on a single-node Loki; we capped range, concurrency, and probe timeouts — same capacity trade-offs as prod.” |
| Proving detection works | “I triggered a policy denial and a runtime alert, then saw both in Grafana — action in the terminal, then the matching log or metric on the panel.” |

#### Other fixes (quick reference)

| If you saw… | Remember… |
|---|---|
| Kyverno panel still 0 after denial | Wait 30–60s for Prometheus scrape; refresh dashboard |
| Request Rate empty | Optional — needs `/metrics` on app images (`build-metrics-images.sh`) |
| Failed login stat 0, log stream has lines | Re-run Exercise C; stats count last **1h** of logs |
| Falco panels empty | Run Exercise B; filter `{namespace="falco", container="falco"}` |
| Audit Log dashboard empty | Expected on MicroK8s — audit logs not shipped to Loki yet |
| Wrong dashboard URL / blank page | Use UID links from §7.3; re-run installer |
| After Mac reboot, auth/ledger **Unknown** or **Init:0/1** | [Path D](#saving-your-progress) — `setup.sh` + `seed-vault-secrets.sh`, delete auth/ledger pods; restore only if that fails |

#### CI issues (before Stage 7 could ship metrics images)

If your pipeline failed earlier in the lab: GitHub Actions `}}` syntax, stale Trivy DB, VM DNS drops, Python 3.13 wheels, Kyverno blocking ArgoCD syncs, Kustomize image tags. Details live in `docs/troubleshooting.md` — not needed for the Grafana exercises.

**30-second interview story:**

> “We wired Kyverno metrics and Falco logs into Grafana. The interesting part was end-to-end validation: I denied a bad pod, exec’d a shell to trigger Falco, and watched both show up on security dashboards. We also had to tune Loki on a single-node cluster when wide time ranges caused query timeouts.”

---

### 7.9 — If panels look wrong after a repo update

Re-apply dashboards, then generate **real** events (§7.4 — not fake data):

```bash
bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/install-observability.sh
# Then run Exercises A–C from §7.4 (Kyverno denial, Falco shell, failed logins)
```

Open Grafana at **Last 1 hour**, wait ~30–60s after each exercise, refresh once. See §7.10 for what each dashboard should show.

---

### 7.10 — After `make demo-7`: what each dashboard should look like

Ran on this lab cluster after `SKIP_PROMPT=1 make demo-7` (same as §7.4). Use this to compare your screen.

#### 1 — Kyverno Policy Violations

**URL:** http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-kyverno-violations?from=now-15m&to=now

| Panel | Expected appearance |
|---|---|
| **Policy Violations (24h)** | Large number ≥ 1 (may be red background) |
| **Violations (last hour)** | **≥ 1** — primary proof after Exercise A |
| **Active Policies** | Count of ready Kyverno policies (e.g. 5–10+, not zero) |
| **Violation Rate** | Line with a bump in the last ~15 minutes |
| **Top Violated Resource Kinds** | `Pod` bar visible |
| **Violations by Namespace** | `clearledger` line or bar |

**Terminal proof that matches:** `Error from server: admission webhook ... denied` listing `disallow-root-containers`, `require-resource-limits`, etc.

---

#### 2 — Security Event Timeline (Falco)

**URL:** http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-security-events?from=now-15m&to=now

| Panel | Expected appearance |
|---|---|
| **Falco Alerts by Priority** | Line or bar for **CRITICAL** (and maybe WARNING) in last 15m |
| **Alerts by Rule Name** | Slice for rules like **Terminal shell in container** |
| **Recent CRITICAL / WARNING Events** | Log lines: `priority=CRITICAL`, rule about **shell**, pod `auth-service-…` |
| **CRITICAL Alerts (period)** | Stat **≥ 1** |
| **WARNING Alerts (period)** | May be 0 or higher (background noise OK) |
| **Total Events (period)** | ≥ 1 |

**Terminal proof:** `kubectl exec … /bin/sh -c 'id && exit'` → Falco logs mention shell in container.

---

#### 3 — Service Health + Auth Security

**URL:** http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-service-health?from=now-15m&to=now

| Panel | Expected appearance |
|---|---|
| **Failed Login Attempts** | Stat **> 0** (after demo curl loop) |
| **Successful Logins** | May stay **0** — OK |
| **Transaction / large txn stats** | May stay 0 unless you generated ledger traffic |
| **Request Rate** | **Often empty** until CI deploys metrics-enabled images (§7.5) — not required for Stage 7 done |
| **Auth Service Logs** | Lines containing `Failed login attempt` |

---

#### 4 — Compliance Posture (auditor one-pager)

**URL:** http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-compliance?from=now-1h&to=now

| Top stat | Expected after full demo |
|---|---|
| **Policy Violations** | > 0 |
| **Runtime Threats** | > 0 |
| **Failed Auth Attempts** | > 0 |
| Control table lower on page | Tools listed **ACTIVE** (narrative, not live metrics) |

This is screenshot **#3** — three defenses in one frame.

---

#### 5 — Audit Log Analysis

**Empty on MicroK8s — by design, not a bug.** The dashboard queries `{job="kubernetes-audit"}` which requires the Kubernetes API server to write audit logs and Promtail to ship them to Loki. MicroK8s does not enable audit logging by default. This is documented as Phase 2 work. Do not use this dashboard alone to judge Stage 7 completion — the other five dashboards carry the proof.

---

#### 6 — DORA Metrics

Needs ArgoCD deploy activity to accumulate. Shows real data after multiple CI runs. After the pipeline fixes in Stage 7 (serialized builds, Trivy DB prep, Python 3.13 upgrade), you should see at least one successful deploy in the Deployment Frequency panel.

---

#### 7 — Request Rate (Service Health dashboard)

**Was empty until Stage 7 completes the full delivery chain.** Requires:

- App images built with `prom_metrics.py` middleware (`/metrics` endpoint) — added in this stage via CI
- PodMonitor `clearledger-apps` scraping the pods — installed by `install-observability.sh`
- Network policy allowing `monitoring` namespace ingress on port 8000 — fixed in this stage

Once all three are in place, `http_requests_total` appears in Prometheus and the Request Rate panel shows live traffic (confirmed at ~0.83 req/s after Stage 7 fixes).

---

### What you learned in Stage 7

- **Prometheus** proves countable security events (Kyverno denials, HTTP rates)
- **Loki** proves forensic detail (Falco JSON, auth log lines)
- **Grafana** is the narrative layer — not a second install step after the lab
- You can trace: **terminal action → backend signal → panel update**
- ServiceMonitors / PodMonitors are what connect Stages 4–6 to charts
- Empty dashboards mean “no events yet” or “wrong time range” — not “broken security”
- Compliance posture is how you answer an auditor in **one screen**
- Network policies must explicitly allow the `monitoring` namespace to reach app pods on port 8000, otherwise PodMonitor scrapes silently fail with `context deadline exceeded`
- Kubernetes Audit Log dashboard is empty on MicroK8s by design — the API server audit pipeline (audit-policy → file → Promtail → Loki) is not enabled by default
- Request Rate requires the full chain: app image with `/metrics`, PodMonitor, and network policy — any one missing means the panel stays empty

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Built security observability with Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana — dashboards correlating Kyverno violations, Falco alerts, and DORA metrics — and can prove a security event end-to-end from terminal to dashboard.

#### Stage 7 done checklist

- `make check-7` → 6/6 ✓ (Stage 6.5 Litmus failure is expected — scaled down for memory)
- `http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-kyverno-violations` — Violations stat > 0
- `http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-security-events` — CRITICAL Falco alert visible
- `http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-compliance` — Policy Violations + Runtime Threats + Failed Auth Attempts all > 0
- `http://grafana.local/d/clearledger-service-health` — Failed Login Attempts > 0, Request Rate > 0
- Portfolio screenshots 1–3 saved

**Save your VM before Stage 7.5 or Stage 8.** Stage 7 is heavy — disk pressure and Loki crash-loops are common if you skip this. After `make check-7` passes and §7.6 screenshots are done:

```bash
make snapshot STAGE=7
make snapshots    # must show clearledger.stage7 — do not skip
```

If the VM corrupts later: try [Path D — Mac reboot](#saving-your-progress) first (Vault re-bind); if that fails, `make snapshots` then `make restore STAGE=7`. See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

### After Mac reboot — quick recovery

If you closed the laptop or Multipass hung and came back to **Unknown** auth/ledger pods or **Init:0/1** with Vault `permission denied`, follow **Path D** in [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress). You usually do **not** need `make restore` if you have a `stage7` snapshot and Path D succeeds.

---

## Stage 7.5 — OpenTelemetry (Optional)

**Skip this entire stage if you want.** Stage 7 (metrics + logs) is enough to finish the homelab and move to Stage 8. Do 7.5 only if you want traces for your portfolio or interviews — and only if the VM has spare RAM (~1.5 Gi free).

### What traces add

Stage 7 tells you *that* something happened. Traces tell you *where time went* inside a single request.

- **Metrics** — “50 requests, 2 errors in the last minute.”
- **Logs** — “Error at 14:23:07 on this pod.”
- **Traces** — “The JWT call to auth-service took 120ms; Postgres INSERT took 8ms.”

That waterfall is what you build here: one real `POST /transactions` with timings for **ledger-service**, then **auth-service**, then **postgres**.

### Before you start (lab checklist)

Finish Stage 7 first: §7.4 exercises done, §7.6 screenshots saved, `SKIP_CHAOS_CHECK=1 make check-7` passes.

Then check the VM has headroom (`multipass exec clearledger -- free -h` — want ~1.5 Gi free). If you ran Stage 6.5 Litmus, scale it down (§7.0) before adding Tempo.

**Done when:** you see a trace waterfall in Grafana Explore (Tempo) and `make check-75` passes. Save with `make snapshot STAGE=75`.

### Why apps log OTEL warnings today

Since Stage 7 you may see:

```
WARNING: Transient error StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE encountered while exporting traces
```

Each app is already instrumented and tries to send spans to `otel-collector.monitoring:4317`. That service does not exist until this stage. Apps keep working; traces are dropped. Installing the collector below stops the warnings.

### How data flows

1. **ledger-service** (and other apps) — OTel SDK auto-instruments FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
2. **OTel Collector** (`monitoring` namespace, port 4317) — batches spans
3. **Grafana Tempo** — stores traces
4. **Grafana Explore** — Tempo datasource, waterfall view

OpenTelemetry is the standard; Tempo is just the storage backend. Apps send spans to the collector, not directly to Tempo — swap backends later without changing app code.

---

### 7.5.1 — Check memory and load

Tempo needs ~300MB. Confirm headroom before installing:

```bash
multipass exec clearledger -- free -h    # want ~1.5Gi available
multipass exec clearledger -- uptime      # load should be reasonable for your CPU count
SKIP_CHAOS_CHECK=1 bash scripts/health-check.sh 7
```

If Litmus is still running from Stage 6.5, scale it down first (§7.0):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n litmus --field-selector=status.phase=Running
# Expected: no resources found
```

---

### 7.5.2 — Install Grafana Tempo

Tempo is the trace storage backend. Install it into the `monitoring` namespace next to Prometheus and Loki:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

helm install tempo grafana/tempo \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --set tempo.storage.trace.backend=local \
  --set tempo.storage.trace.local.path=/var/tempo \
  --set persistence.enabled=true \
  --set persistence.size=5Gi \
  --wait
```

**Verify Tempo is running:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring -l app.kubernetes.io/name=tempo
# Expected: tempo-0   1/1   Running
```

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring tempo-0 -- wget -qO- http://localhost:3200/ready
# Expected: ready
```

---

### 7.5.3 — Deploy OTel Collector and wire Grafana

This applies the OTel Collector (receives spans from app pods) and registers Tempo as a Grafana datasource automatically via the sidecar:

```bash
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-7.5-opentelemetry/infra/otel/otel-collector.yaml
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-7.5-opentelemetry/infra/otel/grafana-datasource-tempo.yaml
```

**Verify the collector is running:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring -l app=otel-collector
# Expected: otel-collector-xxxxx   1/1   Running
```

**Verify the collector started (not trace receipt yet):**

Apps **push** spans to the collector over OTLP — the collector does not scrape pods. At this step you are only confirming it is listening.

```bash
kubectl logs -n monitoring deploy/otel-collector --tail=15
# Expected:
#   Starting GRPC server ... endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
#   Starting HTTP server ... endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
#   Everything is ready. Begin running and processing data.
# No crash loops or repeated errors.
```

Proof that traces are actually flowing comes later — after you generate traffic in §7.5.6, check collector logs for span export lines from the `debug` exporter, then confirm the trace in Grafana Tempo (§7.5.7).

---

### 7.5.4 — Enable Prometheus remote write receiver

The OTel Collector also forwards OTel metrics to Prometheus via remote write. Prometheus needs to accept them:

```bash
helm upgrade kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  -f stages/stage-7-observability/infra/helm/kube-prometheus-stack-values.yaml \
  --wait
```

This applies the `enableRemoteWriteReceiver: true` setting added to the Helm values in Stage 7.5. Wait for Prometheus to restart (about 60 seconds).

---

### 7.5.5 — Verify app pods connect to the collector

The deployments in `clearledger-infra` already have `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` set. Once the collector is running, the pods auto-connect. Confirm the OTEL warnings are gone:

```bash
kubectl logs -n clearledger deploy/ledger-service -c ledger-service --tail=20 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -v "opentelemetry\|otlp\|Transient" | tail -10
# Expected: only INFO request logs, no WARNING: Transient error
```

If warnings persist, the network policy may not have port 4317 egress. Apply the latest policies:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/deferred-by-stage/stage-6-runtime-security/netpol/network-policies.yaml
```

---

### 7.5.6 — Generate a trace

Now create a transaction and watch it flow through the system:

```bash
# Step 1: register (skip if already registered)
curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"trace-demo@clearledger.io","password":"TracePass123"}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Step 2: login and grab the token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"trace-demo@clearledger.io","password":"TracePass123"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")
echo "Token acquired: ${TOKEN:0:20}..."

# Step 3: create a transaction (this is the request you will trace)
curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/ledger/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 5000, "direction": "credit"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Verify the collector received spans:**

```bash
kubectl logs -n monitoring deploy/otel-collector --tail=30 \
  | grep -iE "Traces|spans|ResourceSpans" || echo "No span lines yet — see §7.5.5 (OTEL env / netpol)"
# Expected after a successful transaction: debug exporter lines mentioning exported traces/spans
```

---

### 7.5.7 — View the trace in Grafana

Open **http://grafana.local** → left sidebar **Explore** (compass icon).

#### Step 1 — Select Tempo and open Search

At the top of the query pane:

1. Datasource dropdown (orange **T** logo) → **Tempo**
2. Query row labeled **A (Tempo)** → three tabs: **Search** | TraceQL | Service Graph
3. Click **Search** — this shows dropdown filters. **TraceQL** is a text box only; if you land there with nothing typed you get `0 series returned`.

#### Step 2 — Filter by service

In the **Search** tab:

- **Service Name** → type or select `ledger-service`
- Leave Span Name, Status, Duration, and Tags empty for now
- Grafana shows the query it will run: `{resource.service.name="ledger-service"}`

Set the time range (top-right clock icon) to **Last 15 minutes** so your §7.5.6 transaction is included.

#### Step 3 — Run the query

Grafana Explore often has **no button labeled “Run query”**. After you pick a service, results may appear automatically. If the table is empty, use the **blue circular refresh button** in the **top-right** of the main pane (next to the time picker). A magnifying-glass icon beside it does the same in some versions.

#### Step 4 — Open the trace waterfall

Below the query editor, find **Table - Traces**. You should see at least one row like:

| Column | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Trace ID | `5730edf3…` (blue link) |
| Start time | when you ran the `curl` |
| Service | `ledger-service` |
| Name | `POST /transactions` |
| Duration | ~200ms (yours may differ) |

**Click the Trace ID link.** The right panel opens the trace detail view.

#### What the trace detail view shows

Header: **`ledger-service: POST /transactions`**

- **Trace ID** — unique ID for this request
- **Duration** — total end-to-end time
- **Services** — `2` (`ledger-service` and `auth-service` for a normal transaction)

Expand spans in the timeline:

```
ledger-service   POST /transactions          (~total duration)
  ├── auth-service   GET /verify             ← JWT check over HTTP
  ├── ledger-service INSERT / sqlalchemy    ← Postgres write
  └── (optional) redis PUBLISH              ← only if amount ≥ notification threshold
```

Click any span bar to see **Span attributes** (HTTP method, status, SQL text) and **Resource attributes** (`service.name`, `k8s.cluster.name=clearledger`, etc.).

**Connecting traces to logs:** with a span selected, open the **Logs** tab — Grafana jumps to matching Loki entries for that pod at that timestamp.

**Screenshot this trace detail view** — portfolio proof for Stage 7.5.

#### TraceQL alternative

Prefer the text box? Switch to the **TraceQL** tab, paste:

```traceql
{ resource.service.name = "ledger-service" }
```

Then use the same **blue refresh** button top-right.

#### If the table is empty

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `0 series returned` on TraceQL | Switch to **Search** tab, or paste the TraceQL query above |
| Search tab, no rows | Widen time range; re-run the §7.5.6 `curl` transaction |
| Error connecting to Tempo | Datasource URL must be port **3200** — `kubectl apply -f stages/stage-7.5-opentelemetry/infra/otel/grafana-datasource-tempo.yaml` then `kubectl rollout restart deployment/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring` |
| No spans in collector logs | See §7.5.5 (OTEL env vars / network policy) |

---

### 7.5.7b — Understand when a trace happens

Tracing is **not always on**. Spans are created only when a request hits an instrumented route. `/health` probes create small traces; your `POST /transactions` in §7.5.6 created the full one.

**One HTTP request → one trace ID → many spans:**

| Span in Tempo | What caused it |
|---------------|----------------|
| `POST /transactions` (`ledger-service`) | Your curl reached the ledger API |
| `GET /verify` (`auth-service`) | Ledger called auth to validate the JWT |
| SQL / sqlalchemy spans | `db.commit()` inserted the row |
| Redis span | Only if `amount >= 10000` (notification threshold in `main.py`) |

Your `amount: 5000` transaction is why you saw auth + SQL but **no redis** — that is expected.

**Why both services share one trace:** OpenTelemetry copies a trace ID into outbound HTTP headers. When ledger calls auth, auth continues the same trace instead of starting a new one.

**Exercise A — map spans to code:** Open `app/ledger-service/main.py`, find `create_transaction`. Each bar in the waterfall maps to a step in that function (`get_current_user` → auth, `db.commit` → SQL, `redis_client.publish` → redis).

**Exercise B — threshold:** Run §7.5.6 again with `"amount": 15000`. Search Tempo — a redis span appears. With `5000` it does not.

**Exercise C — three signals, one request:** Note the trace start time. At the same moment: **Tempo** shows where time went, **Loki** shows what was logged, **Prometheus** shows request rate. Same incident, three lenses.

---

### 7.5.8 — Verify

```bash
make check-75
```

Expected output:

```text
▶ Stage 7.5 — OpenTelemetry (Distributed Tracing)
  ✓ OTel Collector is running (1 replica(s))
  ✓ Grafana Tempo datasource ConfigMap exists
  ✓ Tempo is running
  ✓ auth-service has OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT set
```

**If you see a warning instead:**

```text
⚠ OTel env vars not found on auth-service — redeploy with updated manifests
```

`check-75` looks for `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in the **deployment manifest**. Older Stage 5 manifests may not list it even though tracing works — the Python apps default to `http://otel-collector.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317` when the env var is missing.

You can proceed if collector logs show spans and Tempo shows your trace. To clear the warning, apply **only** the app deployments (not the whole kustomize tree — Kyverno may block redis/postgres patches):

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/auth-service/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/manifests/ledger-service/deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout restart deployment/auth-service deployment/ledger-service -n clearledger
make check-75
```

**Save your VM** after `make check-75` — see the block at the end of Stage 7.5 below.

---

### What you learned

You installed the missing piece from Stage 7: **traces**.

Stage 7 gave you **metrics** (how many requests per second?) and **logs** (what did the app print?). Stage 7.5 adds **traces** (where did one slow request spend its time?).

**Example from this lab:** when you ran `POST /transactions`, Tempo showed one timeline:

- ledger received the request
- ledger called auth to verify your token
- ledger wrote to Postgres

That is one **trace** — one user action, one ID, multiple services. It only exists for that request; nothing is traced when no one is calling the API.

| Signal | Question it answers | You used |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| Metrics | How busy is the service? | Prometheus (Stage 7) |
| Logs | What was logged? | Loki (Stage 7) |
| Traces | Which step in this request was slow? | Tempo (Stage 7.5) |

**If someone asks in an interview:** “I sent one transaction through the API and used Grafana Tempo to see it hit ledger, then auth, then the database — all in one trace.”

---

### Stage 7.5 done — save your VM

Optional stage. Skip the snapshot if you are moving straight to Stage 8 without 7.5.

```bash
make check-75          # confirm tracing stack is up
make snapshot STAGE=75
make snapshots         # must list clearledger.stage75
```

VM broke later? `make snapshots` then `make restore STAGE=75`. Details: [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

---

## Stage 8 — AWS Migration

**Goal:** run the same ClearLedger app on AWS instead of your laptop VM.

You are not rewriting the application. Stages 0–7 built containers on Kubernetes with GitOps, Kyverno, secrets, and observability. Stage 8 changes **where** it runs — you keep the same images, the same ArgoCD workflow, and the same security policies; only the cloud services underneath change (MicroK8s → EKS, Vault → Secrets Manager, and so on).

- **Homelab:** MicroK8s, Postgres in a pod, dev Vault, Docker Hub, `clearledger.local`
- **AWS:** EKS, RDS, Secrets Manager, ECR, ALB hostname

> **Am I ready for Stage 8?**
>
> - [ ] Homelab complete through Stage 7 (Stage 7.5 optional)
> - [ ] `make check-7` passes (and `make check-75` if you did traces)
> - [ ] AWS account with billing alerts enabled — `make aws-up` creates billable resources
> - [ ] Skim §8.2 so you know what `make aws-up` does (even if you use the quick path)
>
> **Done when:** app reachable on the AWS ALB, ArgoCD syncing, and you run `make aws-down` when finished to stop charges.

### What `make aws-up` gives you

This is a **demo stack** — production-*shaped*, not production-*ready*. HTTP only (no TLS cert). Stage 7 observability is installed automatically. CI still runs Gitleaks, Semgrep, Checkov, Trivy, and Cosign.

For real production you would add HTTPS (see `ingress-aws-https.example.yaml`), staging before promote, and alert routing. Those are documented but not applied by the spinup script.

**GitOps rule:** after bootstrap, do not `kubectl apply` app Deployments by hand. ArgoCD owns the cluster (Stage 2). Push manifest changes to Git and let ArgoCD sync.

### Secrets on AWS

On the homelab, Vault injected secret **files**. On AWS, secrets live in **Secrets Manager**. Two ways to get them into pods:

1. **ESO (default in this lab)** — External Secrets Operator copies Secrets Manager → Kubernetes Secret → env vars like `DATABASE_URL`.
2. **CSI (installed + §8.5 exercise)** — mounts secrets as **files** at `/mnt/secrets/*` (no Secret object in etcd). Same code path as Vault homelab.

**IRSA** lets AWS trust a Kubernetes ServiceAccount — no `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` in Git or in the cluster. Details: `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/docs/secrets-patterns.md`.

---

### 8.1 — Two ways through Stage 8

**Quick path (~45–60 min):** edit `terraform/secrets.tf` (replace `CHANGE_ME_BEFORE_APPLY`), then:

```bash
make aws-up    # runs stages/stage-8-aws-migration/scripts/aws-spinup.sh
make aws-down  # destroys billable resources when you are done
```

Read §8.2 afterward so you know what ran.

**Manual path (§8.3):** run Terraform, ECR push, ArgoCD, Kyverno, ESO, and deploy yourself. Use this when learning, interviewing, or debugging a failed spinup.

Do not skip §8.2–§8.5 if you only ran `make aws-up` — otherwise you will not know what Terraform, ESO, or ArgoCD each did.

Before your first Stage 8 push, read [§8 — CI routing and `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET`](#ci-routing-stages-17-vs-stage-8) and set `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET=aws` only after Terraform succeeds — not while you are still on Stages 1–7.

---

### 8.2 — What `make aws-up` runs

The spinup script runs 15 steps in order:

**Setup (1–6)** — check tools and AWS login; `terraform apply` (VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, Secrets Manager, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IAM); confirm security services; build and push images to ECR; patch `manifests/kustomization.yaml` with your registry and git SHA; configure `kubectl` for EKS.

**Platform (7–12)** — install ArgoCD; Kyverno + cluster policies; Falco; External Secrets Operator + IRSA service accounts; CSI secrets driver; Stage 7 observability stack.

**Deploy (13–15)** — ArgoCD app `clearledger-aws` syncs `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/`; wait for ALB hostname; print URL and tear-down reminder.

After the script finishes, open the printed **`http://<alb-dns>/auth/health`** in your browser, or follow [§8.3 — When to open what](#when-to-open-what-checkpoint-map) for Argo CD and Grafana port-forwards.

Default app deploy uses **ESO** for secrets. CSI is also installed so you can try file mounts in §8.5 without extra setup.

**Terraform layout** — there is no `terraform.tf` file. The `terraform {}` block (version, providers, optional S3 backend) is at the top of `main.tf`. Resources are split by topic: `vpc.tf`, `eks.tf`, `rds.tf`, `ecr.tf`, `alb.tf`, `iam.tf`, `secrets.tf`, `security.tf`. Run all commands from `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform/`.

---

### 8.3 — Manual walkthrough

Run these yourself at least once. Paths are from the repo root.

**Commands install things; UIs prove they work.** Homelab Stages 2 and 7 already taught you to open Argo CD and Grafana in a browser. Stage 8 is the same idea — but on AWS there is no `clearledger.local` or `grafana.local` in `/etc/hosts`. You use **port-forward** for control-plane UIs and the **public ALB hostname** for the app.

#### When to open what (checkpoint map)

| When (after…) | Where to look | How to open | What “good” looks like |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 2 — `terraform apply` | **AWS Console** | [EKS](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home?region=eu-west-1) → cluster `clearledger` **Active**; [ECR](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories?region=eu-west-1) → three empty repos; [RDS](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-west-1) → `clearledger-postgres` **Available** | Infra exists before any pods run |
| Step 4 or CI green | **ECR** + **GitHub Actions** | ECR → each repo has your git SHA tag; Actions → **CI — AWS (ECR + OIDC)** all green | Images are in the registry ArgoCD will pull |
| Step 7 — ArgoCD install | **Argo CD UI** | See [👀 Argo CD UI](#-argo-cd-ui-after-step-7) below | Login page loads; later you see app `clearledger-aws` |
| Step 12 — observability | **Grafana** | See [👀 Grafana on AWS](#-grafana-after-step-12) below | Login works; six ClearLedger dashboards listed (panels may be empty until events) |
| Step 13 — ArgoCD app applied | **Argo CD UI** again | Same port-forward → Applications → `clearledger-aws` | **Synced** + **Healthy**; pod tree shows auth/ledger/notification |
| Step 14 — ingress ready | **ALB / app** | See [👀 ALB — first time the app is public](#-alb--first-time-the-app-is-public) below | Browser or `curl` returns JSON `200` on `/auth/health` |
| Optional | **AWS EC2 → Load balancers** | Console → Load Balancers → name `clearledger` | **Active**; targets **healthy** (matches ingress backend pods) |

> **No login SPA on AWS Stage 8.** The AWS manifests deploy **three backend APIs** only (`/auth`, `/ledger`, `/notifications`). There is no frontend Ingress like homelab `clearledger.local`. You prove the stack with **health URLs** and API `curl` — not a browser login screen.

Keep **one terminal** dedicated to each `kubectl port-forward` while you use the UI. `Ctrl+C` in that terminal closes the tunnel.

**Before you start**

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform --version
# Edit stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform/secrets.tf — no CHANGE_ME_BEFORE_APPLY

# REQUIRED before first terraform apply — GitHub Actions OIDC (ci-aws.yaml) reads this at apply time:
cp stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform/terraform.tfvars.example \
   stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform/terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars:
#   github_owner = "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"        # your GitHub user or org
#   eks_public_access_cidrs = ["YOUR.PUBLIC.IP/32"]

terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform validate
# Fails until both the GitHub owner and a trusted EKS API CIDR are configured
```

> **Do not run `terraform apply` until `github_owner` is set.** If you apply with the placeholder,
> AWS creates IAM role `clearledger-github-actions-ecr` with trust `repo:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/...`.
> CI then fails at **Publish images → ECR** with `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.
> Fix: edit `terraform.tfvars` → `terraform apply` again → verify with `aws iam get-role` below →
> **Re-run failed jobs** on the failed Actions run (not the full pipeline).

**Steps 1–2 — Terraform**

```bash
cd stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform
terraform init -upgrade
terraform apply
# Save outputs:
terraform output -raw ecr_registry_url
terraform output -raw github_actions_ecr_role_arn
terraform output -raw eso_role_arn
terraform output -raw auth_service_irsa_role_arn
terraform output -raw kubeconfig_command
cd ../../..
```

**👀 AWS Console (after step 2)** — confirm Terraform created resources before you touch the cluster:

1. **EKS** → Clusters → `clearledger` → **Status: Active**, **3 nodes**
2. **ECR** → Repositories → `clearledger/auth-service`, `ledger-service`, `notification-service` (0 images until step 4 or CI)
3. **RDS** → Databases → `clearledger-postgres` → **Available**

**Verify GitHub OIDC trust (do this before enabling CI)** — the IAM role must list your real GitHub user, not the placeholder:

```bash
aws iam get-role --role-name clearledger-github-actions-ecr \
  --query 'Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument.Statement[0].Condition.StringEquals."token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub"' \
  --output text
```

**Expected:** `repo:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger:environment:production`

**If you see `repo:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/...`:** you applied Terraform before setting `github_owner` in `terraform.tfvars`. Fix `terraform.tfvars`, then `terraform apply` again. CI will fail at **Publish images → ECR** with `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` until this matches.

**After fixing trust policy:** GitHub → Actions → failed **CI — AWS (ECR + OIDC)** run → **Re-run failed jobs** (keeps passed build/scan artifacts; only re-runs ECR publish and downstream). Use **Re-run all jobs** only if you changed app code or need a fresh scan.

> **When did ECR get created?** During `terraform apply` (step 2), not when you `docker push`.
> Terraform provisions empty ECR repositories (`clearledger/auth-service`, `ledger-service`,
> `notification-service`) in **`eu-west-1`**. Check the ECR console **Created at** timestamp —
> it matches your apply time (e.g. `2026-06-30 10:55:31 UTC+01`). Images appear only after
> step 4 (`docker build` + `docker push`). Repos with **0 images** after apply is normal.

**Set your CLI default region** (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, EKS, RDS, and ECR are all regional —
without this, AWS CLI defaults to `us-east-1` and commands look like resources are missing):

```bash
aws configure set region eu-west-1
aws configure get region   # expect: eu-west-1
```

**Steps 3–4 — Security services + ECR images**

```bash
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1   # or rely on aws configure set region above

# Step 3 — verify security services (must pass --region eu-west-1)
aws guardduty list-detectors --region "${AWS_REGION}"
# Expect: DetectorIds: ["<id>"]  — empty [] means wrong region, not "not created"

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name clearledger-trail --region "${AWS_REGION}"
# Expect: IsLogging: true
# Error "Unknown trail ... us-east-1" → you forgot --region eu-west-1

# Step 4 — build and push images to the ECR repos Terraform already created
ECR_REGISTRY=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw ecr_registry_url)
AUTH_ECR=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw auth_service_ecr_url)
LEDGER_ECR=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw ledger_service_ecr_url)
NOTIFY_ECR=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw notification_service_ecr_url)
TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

aws ecr get-login-password --region "${AWS_REGION}" \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "${ECR_REGISTRY}"

docker build -t "${AUTH_ECR}:${TAG}" app/auth-service && docker push "${AUTH_ECR}:${TAG}"
docker build -t "${LEDGER_ECR}:${TAG}" app/ledger-service && docker push "${LEDGER_ECR}:${TAG}"
docker build -t "${NOTIFY_ECR}:${TAG}" app/notification-service && docker push "${NOTIFY_ECR}:${TAG}"

# Confirm images landed (optional)
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name clearledger/auth-service --region "${AWS_REGION}" \
  --query 'imageDetails[*].imageTags' --output table
```

**👀 ECR console (after step 4 or green CI)** — open each repository → **Images** tab. You should see tags matching your git commit SHA. If repos are empty, ArgoCD will show `ImagePullBackOff` later.

**👀 GitHub Actions (if using CI instead of manual push)** — repo → **Actions** → workflow **CI — AWS (ECR + OIDC)**. All jobs green; **Publish images → ECR** succeeded. This is the supply-chain proof before deploy.

**Step 5 — GitOps source of truth**

Patch placeholders in `kustomization.yaml` (same `sed` as `aws-spinup.sh` step 5):

```bash
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
ECR_REGISTRY=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw ecr_registry_url)
TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
KUST=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/kustomization.yaml

sed -i.bak \
  -e "s|REPLACE_ECR_REGISTRY|${ECR_REGISTRY}|g" \
  -e "s|REPLACE_IMAGE_TAG|${TAG}|g" \
  "${KUST}"
rm -f "${KUST}.bak"

# Region in ESO + CSI manifests (only if not eu-west-1)
if [[ "${AWS_REGION}" != "eu-west-1" ]]; then
  sed -i.bak "s|region: eu-west-1|region: ${AWS_REGION}|g" \
    stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/external-secrets.yaml \
    stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/csi/auth-service-spc.yaml \
    stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/csi/ledger-service-spc.yaml
  rm -f stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/external-secrets.yaml.bak \
        stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/csi/*.bak 2>/dev/null || true
fi

# Verify before commit
grep -E 'newName:|newTag:' "${KUST}"
# Expect: YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearledger/... and your git SHA

git add stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/kustomization.yaml
git commit -m "stage8: ECR images ${TAG}"
git push
```

Also fix the ArgoCD Application repo URL once (replace with your GitHub username):

```bash
# Example: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger — check: git remote get-url origin
sed -i.bak 's|YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME|YOUR_ACTUAL_GITHUB_USER|g' \
  stages/stage-8-aws-migration/argocd/clearledger-aws-app.yaml
rm -f stages/stage-8-aws-migration/argocd/clearledger-aws-app.yaml.bak
```

**Step 6 — Cluster access + Terraform outputs**

Run from the **repo root**. Set the CLI region first (EKS and IAM outputs are regional), then kubeconfig, then export IRSA role ARNs — steps 9–10 need them.

```bash
aws configure set region eu-west-1

eval "$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw kubeconfig_command)"
kubectl get nodes

export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
export ESO_ROLE_ARN=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw eso_role_arn)
export FALCO_ROLE_ARN=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw falco_role_arn)
export REPLACE_AUTH_IRSA_ROLE_ARN=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw auth_service_irsa_role_arn)
export REPLACE_LEDGER_IRSA_ROLE_ARN=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw ledger_service_irsa_role_arn)
export REPLACE_NOTIFICATION_IRSA_ROLE_ARN=$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw notification_service_irsa_role_arn)

# Sanity check (all should print ARNs, not empty)
echo "ESO:      ${ESO_ROLE_ARN}"
echo "Falco:    ${FALCO_ROLE_ARN}"
echo "Auth IRSA: ${REPLACE_AUTH_IRSA_ROLE_ARN}"
```

**Steps 7–12 — Platform stack** (same order as `aws-spinup.sh`)

Run **install → verify** for each step before moving on. After every block you should see Running pods (or a ClusterPolicy list) — not just “command finished with no output.”

| Step | Namespace | What you are installing | Rough pod count |
|------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 7 | `argocd` | GitOps controller | ~7 pods |
| 8 | `kyverno` | Admission policies | ~4 pods + ClusterPolicies |
| 9 | `falco` | Runtime detection | 1 DaemonSet pod **per node** (3 on this cluster) |
| 10 | `external-secrets` + `clearledger` | ESO + IRSA ServiceAccounts | ~3 ESO pods + 3 ServiceAccounts |
| 11 | `kube-system` + `clearledger` | CSI driver + AWS provider | 3 driver + 3 provider (one per node) |
| 12 | `monitoring` | Prometheus, Grafana, Loki | ~10+ pods |

---

#### Step 7 — ArgoCD

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl apply -n argocd --server-side --force-conflicts \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/argocd-server -n argocd --timeout=180s
```

**Verify — what got created:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd
kubectl get svc -n argocd
kubectl get deploy -n argocd
```

**Expected:** `argocd-server`, `argocd-repo-server`, `argocd-application-controller`, etc. — most pods **Running** / **1/1** or **2/2**. `argocd-server` Service exposes port 443.

**👀 UI (optional now, required after step 13):** new terminal, leave running — use any free local port (`8081` if `8080` is in use):

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
# Or if 8080 is taken:
# kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8081:443
# https://localhost:8080 (or 8081)  user: admin
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d; echo
```

Applications list is empty until step 13 — that is normal.

---

#### Step 8 — Kyverno + policies

`cosign.pub` / `infra/cosign.pub` are **gitignored** (private key must never commit; public key is learner-specific). The repo ships **example** keys in `require-signed-images.yaml` / `require-signed-images-ecr.yaml`. If you regenerated keys in Stage 3, sync your local public key into policies **before** apply:

```bash
# infra/cosign.pub exists locally but is gitignored — safe to copy into committed policy YAMLs
bash scripts/embed-cosign-pub-in-policies.sh
diff infra/cosign.pub <(grep -A3 'BEGIN PUBLIC KEY' infra/policies/require-signed-images-ecr.yaml | grep -v publicKeys)
```

```bash
helm repo add kyverno https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/ --force-update
helm upgrade --install kyverno kyverno/kyverno \
  --namespace kyverno --create-namespace \
  -f stages/stage-4-admission-control/infra/kyverno/values.yaml \
  --set admissionController.replicas=1 \
  --wait --timeout=180s
kubectl apply -f infra/policies/
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kyverno
kubectl get clusterpolicy
kubectl get clusterpolicy require-signed-images-ecr -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].verifyImages[0].attestors[0].entries[0].keys.publicKeys}' | head -3
```

**Expected:** admission-controller, background-controller, cleanup-controller, reports-controller pods **Running**. `kubectl get clusterpolicy` lists **6+** policies including `require-signed-images-ecr`, `disallow-root-containers`, etc. The `publicKeys` output must show `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`, **not** `PASTE_YOUR_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE` (Kyverno treats a placeholder as a file path and blocks all deploys).

`require-signed-images-ecr` defaults to **Audit** until CI Cosign-signs ECR images (`COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` + `COSIGN_PASSWORD` in GitHub). Unsigned images still deploy; signed-image enforcement is optional later.

If `verify-slsa-provenance` fails to apply (Audit + `mutateDigest`), set `mutateDigest: false` in that file or skip it — it is optional for Stage 8.

---

#### Step 9 — Falco

```bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts --force-update
helm upgrade --install falco falcosecurity/falco \
  --namespace falco --create-namespace \
  -f stages/stage-6-runtime-security/infra/falco/helm-values.yaml \
  --set driver.kind=modern_ebpf \
  --set "serviceAccount.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn=${FALCO_ROLE_ARN}" \
  --wait --timeout=300s
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n falco -o wide
kubectl get daemonset -n falco
kubectl get sa falco -n falco -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn}'; echo
```

**Expected:** Falco **DaemonSet** with **DESIRED = number of nodes** (3); each pod **Running**. ServiceAccount annotation shows your `FALCO_ROLE_ARN`.

---

#### Step 10 — External Secrets Operator + IRSA ServiceAccounts

```bash
helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io --force-update
helm upgrade --install external-secrets external-secrets/external-secrets \
  --namespace external-secrets --create-namespace \
  --set "serviceAccount.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn=${ESO_ROLE_ARN}" \
  --wait --timeout=180s
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/resources/namespace.yaml
envsubst < stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/clearledger-serviceaccounts.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n external-secrets
kubectl get sa -n external-secrets external-secrets -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn}'; echo
kubectl get sa -n clearledger
```

**Expected:** `external-secrets` deployment **Running** (often 3 containers / 1 pod). Three ServiceAccounts in `clearledger`: `auth-service`, `ledger-service`, `notification-service` — each with an `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation. No app pods yet (ArgoCD deploys those in step 13).

---

#### Step 11 — CSI driver + SecretProviderClasses

```bash
bash stages/stage-8-aws-migration/scripts/install-csi-secrets.sh
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep -E 'secrets-store|provider-aws'
kubectl get secretproviderclass -n clearledger
helm list -n kube-system | grep -E 'csi-secrets|secrets-provider'
```

**Expected:** CSI driver pods **3/3 Running** (one per node); AWS provider pods **1/1 Running** per node. Two `SecretProviderClass` objects in `clearledger`. Helm shows `csi-secrets-store` and/or `secrets-provider-aws` **deployed**.

If Helm reports `meta.helm.sh/release-name` conflicts, re-run the script — it installs the AWS provider without duplicating the driver chart.

---

#### Step 12 — Observability

```bash
bash stages/stage-7-observability/scripts/install-observability.sh
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl get svc -n monitoring | grep -E 'grafana|prometheus|loki'
kubectl get configmap -n monitoring -l grafana_dashboard=1 --no-headers | wc -l
```

**Expected:** Grafana **3/3 Running**, Prometheus and Loki pods **Running**. ConfigMap count for dashboards is **6** (ClearLedger dashboards). Script prints `http://grafana.local` — on EKS use port-forward instead:

```bash
# New terminal — keep running
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80
# http://localhost:3000  admin / admin123
# http://localhost:3000/dashboards?tag=clearledger
```

Panels may show **No data** until you trigger events (§7.4 exercises work on this cluster too).

---

**Platform stack summary** — quick sanity check before step 13:

```bash
for ns in argocd kyverno falco external-secrets monitoring clearledger; do
  echo "=== ${ns} ==="
  kubectl get pods -n "${ns}" --no-headers 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c || echo "(no pods yet)"
done
kubectl get clusterpolicy --no-headers | wc -l | xargs echo "ClusterPolicies:"
kubectl get secretproviderclass -n clearledger --no-headers | wc -l | xargs echo "SecretProviderClasses:"
```

**Expected:** every namespace shows only `Running` (or `Completed` for jobs); `clearledger` may be empty until ArgoCD syncs. ClusterPolicies ≥ 6. SecretProviderClasses = 2.

> **EKS API timeout on namespace create?** You may see
> `Unexpected error when reading response body` / `context deadline exceeded`
> and still get `namespace/argocd created`. That is a **transient client timeout** talking to the EKS API (first request, slow network, or control plane catching up) — not a failed create. Confirm with `kubectl get namespace argocd` and continue. If commands keep timing out, retry once or run `kubectl cluster-info` to verify connectivity.

**Steps 13–14 — Deploy via ArgoCD + see the ALB**

**ArgoCD repo access:** private repos need a PAT in Argo CD → Settings → Repositories. After making the repo **public**, refresh the app — `ComparisonError: authentication required` should disappear.

**Common sync blockers after repo access works:**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `external-secrets.io/v1beta1` not found | Push `external-secrets.yaml` with `apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1` |
| Kyverno `PASTE_YOUR_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE: no such file` | `bash scripts/embed-cosign-pub-in-policies.sh` then `kubectl apply -f infra/policies/` |
| `SecretSyncedError` auth `database_url does not exist` | Auth SM secret holds `jwt_secret` only; ESO pulls `database_url` from `clearledger/ledger-service` (same RDS URL) |
| Pods `Pending` / Too many pods | EKS lab nodes are small — scale node group or reduce replicas in manifests |

```bash
kubectl apply -f stages/stage-8-aws-migration/argocd/clearledger-aws-app.yaml
```

---

#### 👀 Step 13 — Watch ArgoCD sync (UI + CLI)

Open the Argo CD browser tab you kept open (port-forward from step 7).

```
https://localhost:8080        ← or 8081 if 8080 was busy
```

Click **`clearledger-aws`**. You want to see:

```
APP HEALTH    → Healthy       (green circle)
SYNC STATUS   → Synced        (green tick)
```

It usually takes **2–5 minutes** on first deploy. You can watch the same info from the terminal without touching the browser:

```bash
kubectl get application clearledger-aws -n argocd -w
# Ctrl-C when HEALTH STATUS shows Healthy
```

While that's settling, watch pods start up in a second terminal:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -w
# All pods should reach 1/1 Running within 2 minutes
# Ctrl-C when everything is Running
```

---

#### 👀 Step 14 — Get your public app URL (ALB)

AWS takes **2–5 minutes** after ArgoCD syncs to provision the load balancer.
Run this and wait until the ADDRESS column fills in:

```bash
kubectl get ingress clearledger-ingress -n clearledger -w
# ADDRESS is empty at first, then shows something like:
# clearledger-xxxxxxxxxx.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
# Ctrl-C once the hostname appears
```

Export the URL for the steps below:

```bash
export ALB_DNS=$(kubectl get ingress clearledger-ingress -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
echo "Your app is live at: http://${ALB_DNS}"
```

> **Still empty after 10 minutes?** See [ALB hostname never appears](#alb-hostname-never-appears) in §Troubleshooting.

---

#### 👀 Step 15 — Open the app in your browser

Paste this URL directly into your browser — no DNS entry, no port-forward, no VPN needed. It is a real public URL:

```
http://clearledger-xxxxxxxxxx.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/auth/health
```

You should see:

```json
{"status":"ok","service":"auth-service"}
```

Check all three services:

| Browser URL | What you expect to see |
|---|---|
| `http://${ALB_DNS}/auth/health` | `{"status":"ok","service":"auth-service"}` |
| `http://${ALB_DNS}/ledger/health` | `{"status":"ok","service":"ledger-service"}` |
| `http://${ALB_DNS}/notifications/health` | `{"status":"ok","service":"notification-service"}` |

Or check all three at once from the terminal:

```bash
for path in auth/health ledger/health notifications/health; do
  echo -n "  http://${ALB_DNS}/${path}  →  "
  curl -fsS "http://${ALB_DNS}/${path}" || echo "FAILED"
done
```

Expected output:

```
  http://.../auth/health         →  {"status":"ok","service":"auth-service"}
  http://.../ledger/health       →  {"status":"ok","service":"ledger-service"}
  http://.../notifications/health →  {"status":"ok","service":"notification-service"}
```

---

#### 👀 Step 16 — Verify in the AWS Console (optional but recommended)

This is what the deployed stack looks like from AWS side:

| Console location | What to look for |
|---|---|
| **EC2 → Load Balancers** | A load balancer named `clearledger-…` with state **Active** |
| **EC2 → Target Groups** | Two or three target groups, all targets showing **healthy** |
| **ECR → Repositories** | `clearledger/auth-service`, `clearledger/ledger-service`, `clearledger/notification-service` — each with a recently pushed image tag |
| **EKS → Clusters → clearledger → Workloads** | Your pods shown as Running in the `clearledger` namespace |
| **Secrets Manager** | `clearledger/auth-service`, `clearledger/ledger-service`, `clearledger/postgres` — all present |

> **502/503 from the ALB?** The load balancer is up but the pods aren't healthy yet, or the secrets haven't synced. Check: `kubectl get pods -n clearledger` (all `1/1 Running`?) and `kubectl get externalsecret -n clearledger` (both `SecretSynced True`?).

---

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — app is publicly reachable**

```bash
# All three must print {"status":"ok",...}
curl -fsS "http://${ALB_DNS}/auth/health"         && echo
curl -fsS "http://${ALB_DNS}/ledger/health"        && echo
curl -fsS "http://${ALB_DNS}/notifications/health" && echo

# All pods Running
kubectl get pods -n clearledger

# Nothing printed here = all pods Running (non-Running pods would show)
kubectl get pods -n clearledger --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
```

> `ImagePullBackOff` in the pod list means ECR images aren't there yet — check GitHub Actions and re-run the workflow. A `502` from the health URL means the pod isn't ready yet — wait 30 seconds and retry.

---

### 8.4 — Verify ESO (default secret path)

After sync, confirm External Secrets pulled from Secrets Manager:

```bash
kubectl get externalsecret,secret -n clearledger
kubectl describe externalsecret auth-service-secret -n clearledger | grep -A2 Status
kubectl get pods -n clearledger -l app=auth-service
kubectl exec -n clearledger deploy/auth-service -c auth-service -- env | grep DATABASE_URL
# Expect DATABASE_URL set from K8s Secret — not a file path
```

If `SecretSynced=False`, check ESO logs and IRSA:

```bash
kubectl logs -n external-secrets deploy/external-secrets -c external-secrets | tail -30
kubectl get sa auth-service -n clearledger -o yaml | grep role-arn
```

**✋ Hands-on checkpoint — External Secrets actually synced from AWS**

```bash
kubectl get externalsecret -n clearledger
kubectl get secret -n clearledger
```

Expected: `auth-service-secret` and `ledger-service-secret` each show `SecretSynced` / Ready `True`; the matching Kubernetes Secrets exist in `clearledger`. A `SecretSyncedError` means IRSA/IAM can't reach Secrets Manager — fix the role binding before §8.5.

If you skip this, §8.5 (CSI driver) builds on working secret access, and a silent IAM failure here surfaces as an unrelated-looking pod error two sections later.

---

### 8.5 — Hands-on: CSI driver (file mounts)

The default pods already use ESO — secrets arrive as environment variables from a Kubernetes Secret object. This exercise switches `auth-service` to the CSI path instead: secrets are mounted as plain files under `/mnt/secrets/`, and the app reads them from disk. It is the same code path the homelab uses with Vault (`DATABASE_URL_FILE` / `JWT_SECRET_FILE`).

CSI was already installed at spinup step 11, so there is nothing extra to install.

**Step 1 — confirm CSI is running**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver
kubectl get secretproviderclass -n clearledger
```

You should see one CSI driver pod per node, and two `SecretProviderClass` objects — one for auth-service and one for ledger-service.

**Step 2 — swap the deployment in Git**

Open `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/kustomization.yaml` and change one line:

```yaml
# Before
  - deployments/auth-service.yaml

# After
  - deployments/auth-service-csi.yaml
```

Commit and push, then sync:

```bash
argocd app sync clearledger-aws
kubectl rollout status deployment/auth-service -n clearledger
```

ArgoCD will roll out a new auth-service pod with the CSI volume attached.

**Step 3 — confirm the files are there**

```bash
# Find the new pod
kubectl get pod -n clearledger -l secrets=csi

# List the mounted secret files
kubectl exec -n clearledger deploy/auth-service -- ls /mnt/secrets

# Check the database URL was written correctly
kubectl exec -n clearledger deploy/auth-service -- cat /mnt/secrets/database_url

# Confirm the service is still healthy
curl -s "http://$(kubectl get ingress clearledger-ingress -n clearledger \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')/auth/health"
```

You should see `database_url` and `jwt_secret` listed as files, and the health check should return `{"status":"ok"}`.

**What changed — ESO vs CSI**

With ESO (the default), the External Secrets Operator reads from Secrets Manager using its own IAM role and writes a Kubernetes Secret object into etcd. The pod reads it as an environment variable.

With CSI, the pod itself holds the IAM role. When the pod starts, the kubelet calls the CSI driver, which calls Secrets Manager directly, and mounts the result as files. Nothing is written to etcd.

The application code handles both paths via `_read_secret()` in `app/auth-service/main.py` — it checks for a `_FILE` env var first (file path) and falls back to a direct env var. No code change is needed.

To go back to ESO, switch `kustomization.yaml` back to `auth-service.yaml` and sync again.

---

**Terraform** provisions all the AWS resources — VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, Secrets Manager, and IAM roles — from `.tf` files in `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform/`.

### Two OIDC ideas in Stage 8

Stage 8 uses OIDC in two different places. They sound similar, but they solve different problems.

**GitHub Actions OIDC** lets the CI pipeline push images to ECR without storing long-lived AWS keys in GitHub. When a job runs, GitHub mints a short-lived token that proves the job's identity. AWS trusts that token and hands back temporary credentials — enough to push images and nothing else.

**IRSA** does the same thing, but for pods running inside EKS. Instead of a GitHub token, the pod presents its Kubernetes ServiceAccount token. AWS trusts the EKS cluster's OIDC provider, verifies the token, and returns temporary credentials scoped to exactly what that pod needs.

It helps to see what each one says:

```text
GitHub Actions OIDC:
  Pipeline says → "I am a job in the production environment of YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger"
  AWS replies   → "Here are credentials to push to ECR, valid for one hour"

IRSA:
  Pod says   → "I am the auth-service ServiceAccount in the clearledger namespace"
  AWS replies → "Here are credentials to read only the auth-service secret, valid for one hour"
```

The key is what is *not* stored anywhere:

```text
No AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID in GitHub Secrets
No AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in GitHub Secrets
No AWS keys inside Kubernetes Secrets
```

Terraform creates the role `clearledger-github-actions-ecr` and wires up the trust policies for both. The pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci-aws.yaml` assumes that role, pushes images to ECR, and updates `kustomization.yaml`. ArgoCD picks up the change and deploys the new images.

### CI routing: Stages 1–7 vs Stage 8 {#ci-routing-stages-17-vs-stage-8}

The repo ships two workflow files. You do not need both running at the same time.

`ci.yaml` is the homelab pipeline from Stages 1–7. It runs on your self-hosted Multipass VM, pushes images to Docker Hub, and updates your `clearledger-infra` GitOps repo. This is the default — nothing to configure.

`ci-aws.yaml` is the AWS pipeline for Stage 8. It runs on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` runners, pushes images to ECR, and updates `kustomization.yaml` directly in this repo. It only activates when you set the repo variable `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET=aws`.

**If you are on Stages 1–7, do nothing.** The `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET` variable is unset by default, so every push runs `ci.yaml` on your self-hosted runner as normal. The AWS workflow file exists in the repo but its jobs are skipped.

> **Do not set `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET=aws` until your EKS cluster is running.**
>
> If you set it early, `ci.yaml` stops running on push (no more Docker Hub builds), and `ci-aws.yaml` will fail immediately because there is no ECR, no OIDC role, and no AWS infrastructure yet. If you accidentally set it, delete the variable: GitHub → repo **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **Variables** → delete `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET`.

**Enabling AWS CI (do this after `terraform apply` completes)**

You need three repository variables and one secret in a `production` environment.

First, set the variables — replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

```bash
gh variable set CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET --body aws --repo YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger
gh variable set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID --body "$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)" --repo YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger
gh variable set AWS_REGION --body eu-west-1 --repo YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger
```

Then create the `production` environment and add the OIDC role ARN as a secret:

```bash
# Create the environment first — gh secret set returns 404 if it does not exist
gh api --method PUT "repos/YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger/environments/production"

gh secret set AWS_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN \
  --env production \
  --body "$(terraform -chdir=stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform output -raw github_actions_ecr_role_arn)" \
  --repo YOUR_USERNAME/clearledger
```

> Note: GitHub blocks secret names that start with `GITHUB_`. Use `AWS_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN`, not `GITHUB_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN`.

Also make sure `github_owner` is set correctly in `terraform.tfvars` (see `terraform.tfvars.example`) before running `terraform apply`. This wires up the OIDC trust policy so AWS will accept tokens from your specific GitHub account.

Once `CLEARLEDGER_CI_TARGET=aws` is set, every push to `main` runs the AWS pipeline: Gitleaks → Semgrep → Checkov → build → Trivy scan → ECR push → kustomization update. The homelab `ci.yaml` is skipped.

**If CI fails at the ECR push step**

The most common failure is `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. This means the IAM role trust policy still has a placeholder `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` in the `:sub` condition. Fix it by setting `github_owner` in `terraform.tfvars` and running `terraform apply` again, then re-run only the failed job (not the whole pipeline — the earlier scan steps already passed).

```text
GitHub → Actions → failed run → Re-run failed jobs
```

If you see `404` when running `gh secret set`, the `production` environment does not exist yet — run the `gh api --method PUT` command above first.

**Re-run after fixing OIDC — failed jobs only, not the full pipeline.** Earlier gates (Gitleaks, build, scan) already passed; their artifacts are still in the workflow run. Use **Re-run all jobs** only if you changed app code or want a clean scan from scratch.

### Production Hardening Checklist

The lab architecture is production-style, but a real production setup needs extra guardrails. Add these before you describe it as production-ready.

#### 1. Protect the main branches

Protect both GitHub repos:

```text
github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger
github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-infra
```

Go to each repo:

```text
Settings
→ Rules
→ Rulesets
→ New ruleset
→ Branch targeting: main
```

Enable:

```text
Require a pull request before merging
Require approvals
Require status checks to pass
Require branches to be up to date before merging
Block force pushes
Block branch deletion
```

Why this matters: nobody should push straight to the code repo or the GitOps repo in production. A bad direct push to `clearledger-infra` is a direct deployment request.

#### 2. Use GitHub Environments with approvals

Create a protected environment:

```text
clearledger repo
→ Settings
→ Environments
→ New environment
→ Name: production
→ Required reviewers: add yourself or the team
→ Deployment branches: main only
```

The AWS workflow uses:

```yaml
environment: production
```

That means GitHub pauses the AWS deployment until an approved reviewer allows it. This creates a real promotion gate instead of "every push deploys to prod."

#### 3. Prefer fine-grained tokens or a GitHub App

For the basic lab, `INFRA_REPO_TOKEN` can be a classic PAT. For production, tighten it.

Better option:

```text
Fine-grained personal access token
→ Repository access: only YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger-infra
→ Permissions:
   Contents: Read and write
   Metadata: Read
```

Best option for teams: use a GitHub App installed only on `clearledger-infra`, with permission to write contents. That gives better audit logs and easier rotation than a personal token.

Store `INFRA_REPO_TOKEN` as a **production environment secret**, not a general repository secret:

```text
clearledger
→ Settings
→ Environments
→ production
→ Environment secrets
→ INFRA_REPO_TOKEN
```

#### 4. Lock AWS OIDC to the production environment

The Stage 8 Terraform does this in `iam.tf`:

```text
token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub
= repo:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/clearledger:environment:production
```

That means AWS only trusts GitHub jobs from the `production` environment. A random branch, fork, or unapproved workflow run cannot assume the ECR push role.

Important nuance: AWS IAM can reliably check the GitHub OIDC `aud` and `sub` claims. Use the protected GitHub environment and branch protection to control which workflow can reach that environment.

#### 5. Use staging to production promotion

The simplest lab flow is:

```text
main → ci-aws.yaml → update stages/stage-8-aws-migration/manifests/kustomization.yaml → ArgoCD clearledger-aws syncs
```

Homelab Stages 1–7 still use `clearledger-infra` + Docker Hub. Stage 8 AWS uses the in-repo kustomize path above.

A production flow should be:

```text
main
  ↓
Build image once
  ↓
Deploy to staging
  ↓
Run smoke tests / DAST / manual approval
  ↓
Promote same image SHA to production
```

Do **not** rebuild for production. Promote the same image digest or SHA that passed staging.

#### 6. Use private networking where possible

For production AWS:

```text
EKS nodes in private subnets
RDS in private subnets
Private EKS API endpoint, or restricted public endpoint
Security groups scoped to required ports only
ALB public only if the app is public
No SSH-based deployment path
```

The pipeline should talk to AWS APIs through IAM/OIDC and deploy through GitOps. It should not SSH into EC2 instances.

#### 7. Store Terraform state remotely

Local Terraform state is fine for a lab. Production should use encrypted remote state:

```text
S3 bucket for terraform.tfstate
DynamoDB table for state locking
SSE encryption enabled
Bucket versioning enabled
Public access blocked
```

The Terraform backend block is already included in `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/terraform/main.tf` as a commented template. Uncomment it after you create the S3 bucket and DynamoDB lock table.

#### Production-ready summary

```text
CI builds and proves the artifact.
GitHub Environments approve production.
OIDC gives short-lived AWS credentials.
ECR stores immutable images.
kustomization.yaml (Stage 8 path) records desired state.
ArgoCD clearledger-aws deploys from Git.
No SSH. No static AWS keys. No direct kubectl from CI.
```

Open the URL. ClearLedger is running on AWS. Same architecture, same security layers, new infrastructure.

**Destroy when done — this stops all charges:**

```bash
make aws-down
```

See `stages/stage-8-aws-migration/README.md` for the full walkthrough and cost reference.

### What you learned in Stage 8

- That containerized applications are portable — the same code runs on your laptop and on AWS
- What Terraform does: declares infrastructure as code so environments are reproducible
- What changes in a cloud migration (managed services, IAM, networking) and what does not (application code, CI logic, security policies)
- Three AWS secret delivery paths: ESO (default), CSI file mounts (§8.5), vs Vault on homelab
- AWS-specific security services: GuardDuty (threat detection), CloudTrail (API audit), GitHub Actions OIDC (pipeline AWS auth without long-lived keys), and IRSA (pod-level IAM without long-lived credentials)

**What you can now put on your CV / say in an interview:**

> Migrated the same architecture to AWS — EKS, ECR, RDS, ALB, with secrets via External Secrets Operator and IRSA — provisioned by Terraform, without rewriting the application.

**When you are done on AWS, tear down to stop charges:**

```bash
make aws-down
```

Your homelab VM is separate — if you plan to return to it, you should already have a snapshot from Stage 7 (`make snapshots` to confirm). See [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress).

## Troubleshooting

**Pod stuck in Pending:**

```bash
kubectl describe pod POD_NAME -n clearledger
# Insufficient memory/cpu → reduce resource requests
# Image pull error → check Docker Hub repo name and credentials
```

**Kyverno blocking a deployment:**

```bash
kubectl get events -n clearledger --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -10
kubectl get policyreport -n clearledger -o yaml
```

**Vault agent not injecting secrets:**

```bash
kubectl logs POD_NAME -n clearledger -c vault-agent-init
kubectl exec -n vault vault-0 -- vault read auth/kubernetes/role/auth-service
```

**Falco not firing alerts:**

```bash
kubectl logs -n falco daemonset/falco | grep -i error | tail -20
```

**ArgoCD shows OutOfSync:**

```bash
argocd app sync clearledger --force
argocd app get clearledger
kubectl get events -n clearledger --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

**clearledger.local not resolving:**

```bash
multipass info clearledger | grep IPv4
grep clearledger /etc/hosts
# If the IP changed, update /etc/hosts
```

**VM disk full or pods Evicted (disk pressure):**

```bash
make doctor     # PASS / WARN / FAIL + PVC and Prometheus TSDB sizes
make reclaim    # safe reclaim — unused images + journald only (not PVCs)
```

If still FAIL after reclaim, tear down and recreate: `make teardown && make setup`. Full guidance: [Disk health (long-running lab VM)](#disk-health-long-running-lab-vm) and [troubleshooting.md — VM disk](troubleshooting.md#vm-disk-full-or-nearly-full).

## Interview Preparation

Full weak/strong answers: [`docs/interview-prep.md`](interview-prep.md)

Practice these as you finish each stage:

**Stage 0:** How does traffic reach your services in Kubernetes? What breaks first when deployment is manual?

**Stage 1:** How do you prove what image is deployed for a given commit? What stops a developer bypassing CI?

**Stage 2:** What does GitOps mean mechanically? How do you prove drift is corrected automatically?

**Stage 3:** Difference between SAST, IaC scanning, and image scanning? Where do you draw the line for fail-on severity?

**Stage 4:** What is admission control and why is it different from CI? How would you safely introduce a policy exception?

**Stage 5:** Why are Kubernetes Secrets not "secret management"? How do you rotate secrets with minimal downtime risk?

**Stage 6:** What does runtime detection catch that CI and admission cannot? What is your first response to a shell-spawn alert?

**Stage 7:** What is the difference between a dashboard and an alert? How do you produce audit evidence, not just claims?

**Stage 8:** What actually changes when you move to EKS? What should not change? How does IRSA reduce risk?
