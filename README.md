# ClearLedger DevSecOps Lab

## What You Are Building

ClearLedger is a three-service fintech transaction ledger:

| Service | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `auth-service` | Registration, login, JWT issuance |
| `ledger-service` | Create transactions, balance, history |
| `notification-service` | Event-driven alerts on large transactions |
| `frontend` | Web UI: same APIs, visual proof it works |

The app is the vehicle. DevSecOps is the lesson.

## Architecture

![ClearLedger Architecture](./assets/images/readme_architecture.png)

**Security layers added across 10 stages:**

- CI gates: Gitleaks → Semgrep → Checkov → Trivy → Syft/Grype → Cosign
- Runtime + ops: ArgoCD → Kyverno → Vault → Falco → LitmusChaos → Grafana → OpenTelemetry

## The 10 Stages

| Stage | What Changes | The Problem It Solves |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Raw Kubernetes** | App running, manual deploys | You need to see the system before automating it |
| **1 — CI Pipeline** | Builds automate on push | Manual docker build/push doesn't scale |
| **2 — GitOps (ArgoCD)** | Pipeline stops touching kubectl | Cluster and Git drift apart |
| **3 — Security Gates** | Scans block every commit | Bad code reaches the cluster undetected |
| **4 — Admission Control** | Kyverno enforces policy | Bad manifests reach running pods |
| **5 — Secrets Management** | Vault replaces K8s Secrets | Credentials live in Git and etcd |
| **6 — Runtime Security** | Falco watches live pods | Threats inside running containers go undetected |
| **6.5 — Chaos Engineering** *(Optional)* | LitmusChaos kills pods, injects latency, fills memory | You detect threats but never proved you survive them |
| **7 — Observability** | Security dashboards + DORA metrics | Security you can't measure, you can't prove |
| **7.5 — OpenTelemetry** *(Optional)* | OTel SDK + distributed traces in Grafana Tempo | You see metrics but not the cross-service request journey |
| **8 — AWS Migration** | Swap endpoints | Cloud-ready without relearning everything |

> Stages 6.5 and 7.5 are optional extensions. Complete the numbered stages first.

**Do them in order. Each stage earns the next.**

## What's Inside

| | |
|---|---|
| 3 FastAPI microservices | Auth, ledger, notifications — real fintech domain |
| 10 staged READMEs | Each stage is a self-contained learning unit |
| Full DevSecOps pipeline | Gitleaks → Semgrep → Checkov → Trivy → Cosign |
| 5 Grafana dashboards | Importable JSON — security posture visible immediately |
| Terraform for AWS | VPC, EKS, ECR, RDS, GuardDuty, CloudTrail; one command |
| Stage health check | `bash scripts/health-check.sh [n]` — green or red, fix the red |
| Local integration stack | `make integration-up` → http://localhost:3000 ; see `docs/LAB-GUIDE.md` |
| Interview prep guide | Questions interviewers actually ask, answers that close offers |
| Compliance mapping | Every control mapped to PCI-DSS, SOC2, CIS, NIST, SLSA |

## CI/CD

| Platform | Pipeline file | Registry | Runner |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` | Docker Hub | Self-hosted runner inside the Multipass VM |

The pipeline runs on GitHub Actions with a self-hosted runner installed inside your VM. This lets the runner reach your local cluster and Docker Hub. Employers can see your pipeline runs publicly on GitHub.

**Maintainers:** `TRIVY_VERSION` in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` is pinned and should be bumped periodically, but a "new Trivy version available" notice in scan logs does **not** cause failures; scan gate failures are always fixable CVEs. Learners: see [LAB-GUIDE §3.5](docs/LAB-GUIDE.md#35--when-a-scan-fails-on-a-cve-you-didnt-inject).

## Setting Up Your Repository

```bash
# Clone or download this repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/clearledger.git
cd clearledger

# See all available commands
make

# Start the lab
make setup
make stage-0
```

Windows users: `make` works in Git Bash. Browser open commands use the URL printed, open it manually in your browser.

```bash
# Create the infra repo (separate — ArgoCD watches this one)
# On GitHub: create a new repo called clearledger-infra (Stage 1 covers this)
```

This repo contains the application code and lab stages.
The infra repo contains only Kubernetes manifests.
Keep them separate, this separation is the GitOps pattern you're learning.

## Prerequisites

See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md): up and running in under 10 commands.

Finished the lab? See [SHOWCASE.md](./SHOWCASE.md): how to screenshot, post on LinkedIn, and talk about it in interviews.

## See It Working in 5 Minutes

After `QUICKSTART.md`:

```bash
# First, register a user
curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@clearledger.io","password":"SecurePass123"}' | jq .

# Then login
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://clearledger.local/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@clearledger.io","password":"SecurePass123"}' \
  | jq -r .access_token)

curl -s http://clearledger.local/ledger/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .
# {"user_id":"...","balance":0.0}
```

If you see that JSON, ClearLedger is running. Everything after this is securing it.

Or open the web UI: `make open-ui` (or visit http://clearledger.local).

## Repository Layout

- `app/`: auth/ledger/notification services + frontend SPA
- `infra/`: cumulative manifests/policies (current state)
- `stages/`: 8 learning units (only what changes per stage)
- `scripts/`: setup + health-check helpers
- `docs/`: compliance + troubleshooting + interview prep

**Rule:** stage folders show what’s new; root `infra/` reflects your current end state.

## Who This Is For

**Junior DevOps (0–2 yrs):** Do every stage in order. Don't skip.
The pain of each stage is why the next one exists.

**Mid-level DevOps (2–4 yrs):** Stages 3–7 are where the value is.
Skim 0–2, focus on the security pipeline and runtime layers.

**Interview prep:** Complete through Stage 4.
Read `docs/interview-prep.md`. The questions and answers are based on
exactly what is in this lab — not generic DevOps questions.

**Portfolio:** Push to GitHub, use `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
A working DevSecOps pipeline running against a real fintech app
is visible evidence of capability.

## Go beyond the lab

You have built the project. Now learn the thinking behind it.

These are guided ebooks — the same mental model behind ClearLedger, built from 4+ years of production DevOps work.

| Resource | What you will learn |
|---|---|
| [**DevOps Operating System**](https://osomudeya.gumroad.com/l/devops-atlas) | Most beginners learn Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform separately. Interviews do not test them separately. Why production systems are designed the way they are, how the pieces fit together, and how to think like an engineer instead of following tutorials. |
| [**DevOps Interview Decoder**](https://osomudeya.gumroad.com/l/pcpbks) | If you have built projects but freeze when someone asks "Why is it designed this way?", this is for you. The hidden purpose behind common DevOps interview questions and how to explain your decisions with confidence. Pairs with [`docs/interview-prep.md`](./docs/interview-prep.md). |
